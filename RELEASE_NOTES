RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.3
10 January 2011


IMPORTANT NOTE:
If using the slurmdbd (SLURM DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 2.3 slurmdbd will work with SLURM daemons of version 2.1.3 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysqld.
This is needed when converting large tables over to the new database schema.

SLURM can be upgraded from version 2.2 to version 2.3 without loss of jobs or
other state information.


HIGHLIGHTS
==========
* For architectures where the slurmd daemon executes on front end nodes (Cray
  and BlueGene systems) more than one slurmd daemon may be executed using more
  than one front end node for improved fault-tolerance and performance.
  NOTE: The slurmctld daemon will report the lack of a front_end_state file
  as an error when first started in this configuration.


CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see "man slurm.conf" for details)
=============================================================
* In order to support more than one front end node, new parameters have been
  added to support a new data structure: FrontendName, FrontendAddr, Port,
  State and Reason.

* DebugFlags of Frontend added

* Added new configuration parameter MaxJobId. Use with FirstJobId to limit
  range of job ID values.


COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
* scontrol has the ability to get and set front end node state.

* Add new scontrol option of "show aliases" to report every NodeName that is
  associated with a given NodeHostName when running multiple slurmd daemons
  per compute node (typically used for testing purposes).

	max_job_id		maximum supported job id before starting over
				with first_job_id
