RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.3
28 July 2011


IMPORTANT NOTE:
If using the slurmdbd (SLURM DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 2.3 slurmdbd will work with SLURM daemons of version 2.1.3 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysqld.
This is needed when converting large tables over to the new database schema.

SLURM can be upgraded from version 2.2 to version 2.3 without loss of jobs or
other state information.


HIGHLIGHTS
==========
* Support has been added for Cray XT and XE computers
* Support has been added for BlueGene/Q computers.
* For architectures where the slurmd daemon executes on front end nodes (Cray
  and BlueGene systems) more than one slurmd daemon may be executed using more
  than one front end node for improved fault-tolerance and performance.
  NOTE: The slurmctld daemon will report the lack of a front_end_state file
  as an error when first started in this configuration.
* The ability to expand running jobs was added
* The ability to control how many leaf switches a job is allocated and the
  maximum delay to get that leaf switch count can be controlled.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see "man slurm.conf" for details)
=============================================================
* In order to support more than one front end node, new parameters have been
  added to support a new data structure: FrontendName, FrontendAddr, Port,
  State and Reason.
* Added DebugFlags option of Frontend
* Added new configuration parameter MaxJobId. Use with FirstJobId to limit
  range of job ID values.
* Added new configuration parameter MaxStepCount to limit the effect of
  bad batch scripts. The default value is 40,000 steps per job.
* Changed node configuration parameter from "Procs" to "CPUs". Both parameters
  will be supported for now.
* Added GraceTime to Partition and QOS data structures. Preempted jobs will be
  given this time interval before termination.
* Added AccountingStoreJobComment to control storing job's comment field in
  the accounting database.
* More than one TaskPlugin can be configured in a comma separated list.
* DefMemPerCPU, DefMemPerNode, MaxMemPerCPU and MaxMemPerNode configuration
  options added on a per-partition basis.
* SchedulerParameters can now control the maximum delay that a job can set in
  order to be allocated some desired leaf switch count by specifying a value
  for max_switch_wait.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
* Added scontrol ability to get and set front end node state.
* Added scontrol ability to set slurmctld's DebugFlags.
* Added scontrol ability to increment or decrement a job or step time limit.
* Added new scontrol option of "show aliases" to report every NodeName that is
  associated with a given NodeHostName when running multiple slurmd daemons
  per compute node (typically used for testing purposes).
* Added new squeue optioni of -R/--reservation option as a job filter.
* A reservation flag of "License_Only" has been added for use by the sview and
  scontrol commands. If set, then jobs using the reservation may use the
  licenses associated with it plus any compute nodes. Otherwise the job is
  limited to the compute nodes associated with the reservation.
* The dependency option of "expand" has been added. This option identifies a
  job whose resource allocation is intended to be used to expand the allocation
  of another job. See https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm//faq.html#job_size
  for a description of it's use.
* Added --switches option to salloc, sbatch and srun commands to control the
  desired number of switches allocated to a job and the maximum delay before
  starting the job with more leaf switches.
* Added scontrol ability to modify a job's desired switch count or delay.

BLUEGENE SPECIFIC CHANGES
=========================
* Bluegene/Q support added.
* The select/bluegene plugin has been substantially re-written.

OTHER CHANGES
=============
* Improved accuracy of estimated job start time for pending jobs. This should
  substantially improve scheduling of jobs elibable to execute on more than one
  cluster.
* Job dependency information will only show the currently active dependencies
  rather than the original dependencies.
* Added a reservation flag of "License_Only". If set, then jobs using the
  reservation may use the licenses associated with it plus any compute nodes.
* Added proctrack/cgroup and task/cgroup plugins to support Linux cgroups.
