RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 20.11

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 20.11 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 19.05 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 19.05 or 20.02 to version 20.11 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

If using SPANK plugins that use the Slurm APIs, they should be recompiled when
upgrading Slurm to a new major release.

NOTE: Slurmctld is now set to fatal in case of computing node configured with
      CPUs == #Sockets. CPUs has to be either total number of cores or threads.

NOTE: The FastSchedule option has been removed. The FastSchedule=2 functionality
      (used for testing and development) is available as the new
      SlurmdParameters=config_overrides option.

NOTE: Slurmdbd is now set to fatal if slurmdbd.conf file isn't owned by
      SlurmUser or it's mode is not set to 0600.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- The example systemd unit files have been changed to the "simple" type of
    operation, and the daemon will now run in the foreground within systemd
    instead of daemonizing itself.
 -- Log messages enabled by the various DebugFlags have been overhauled, and
    will all print at the verbose() level, and prepend the flag name that is
    associated with a given log message.
 -- A separate unversioned libslurm_pmi.so will be installed, and the libpmi.so
    that Slurm can (optionally) install will link to that rather than libslurm.
    This should resolve long-standing issues when building static OpenMPI
    libraries and later updating your Slurm release, thereby breaking the
    embedded libslurm.so.<version> link in those OpenMPI libraries that were
    inherited from libpmi.so.
 -- accounting_storage/filetxt has been removed as an option.  Please consider
    using accounting_storage/slurmdbd as an alternative.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see man appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 -- Removed "cpusets" option from TaskPluginParam. Please use task/cgroup.
 -- Removed MsgAggregationParams.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- Make sacct get the UID from database instead of from the username and a
    system call. Add --use-local-uid option to sacct to use old behavior.
 -- The '%s' format in -e/-i/-o options to sbatch will expand to "batch" rather
    than "4294967294".
 -- squeue - added "pendingtime" as a option for --Format.

API CHANGES
===========
 -- slurm_ctl_conf_t has been renamed to slurm_conf_t.
 -- slurm_free_kvs_comm_set() has been renamed to slurm_pmi_free_kvs_comm_set(),
    slurm_get_kvs_comm_set() has been renamed to slurm_pmi_get_kvs_comm_set().
 -- slurm_job_step_layout_get() parameters has changed to use slurm_step_id_t
    see slurm.h for new implementation.  If not running hetsteps just put
    NO_VAL as the value for step_het_comp.
 -- slurm_job_step_stat() parameters has changed to use slurm_step_id_t
    see slurm.h for new implementation.  If not running hetsteps just put
    NO_VAL as the value for step_het_comp.
 -- slurm_job_step_get_pids() parameters has changed to use slurm_step_id_t
    see slurm.h for new implementation.  If not running hetsteps just put
    NO_VAL as the value for step_het_comp.
 -- slurmdb_selected_step_t has been renamed slurm_selected_step_t.
 -- slurm_sbcast_lookup() arguments have changed.  It now takes a populated
    slurm_selected_step_t instead of job_id, het_job_offset, step_id.
