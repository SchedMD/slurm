RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 16.05
27 April 2016

IMPORTANT NOTES:
ANY JOBS WITH A JOB ID ABOVE 2,147,463,647 WILL BE PURGED WHEN SLURM IS
UPGRADED FROM AN OLDER VERSION! Reduce your configured MaxJobID value as needed
prior to upgrading in order to eliminate these jobs.

If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 16.05 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 14.11 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysqld. The
buffer pool size must be smaller than the size of the MySQL tmpdir. This is
needed when converting large tables over to the new database schema.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 14.03 or 14.11 to version 15.08 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

If using SPANK plugins that use the Slurm APIs, they should be recompiled when
upgrading Slurm to a new major release.


HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- Implemented and documented PMIX protocol which is used to bootstrap an
    MPI job. PMIX is an alternative to PMI and PMI2.
 -- Change default CgroupMountpoint (in cgroup.conf) from "/cgroup" to
    "/sys/fs/cgroup" to match current standard.
 -- Add Multi-Category Security (MCS) infrastructure to permit nodes to be bound
    to specific users or groups.
 -- Added --deadline option to salloc, sbatch and srun. Jobs which can not be
    completed by the user specified deadline will be terminated with a state of
    "Deadline" or "DL".
 -- Add an "scontrol top <jobid>" command to re-order the priorities of a user's
    pending jobs. May be disabled with the "disable_user_top" option in the
    SchedulerParameters configuration parameter.
 -- Added new job dependency type of "aftercorr" which will start a task of a
    job array after the corresponding task of another job array completes.
 -- Add --gres-flags=enforce-binding option to salloc, sbatch and srun commands.
    If set, the only CPUs available to the job will be those bound to the
    selected GRES (i.e. the CPUs identifed in the gres.conf file will be
    strictly enforced rather than advisory).
 -- Added wrappers for LSF/OpenLava commands
 -- Added Grid Engine options to qsub command wrapper.

RPMBUILD CHANGES
================
 -- Remove all *.la files from RPMs.
 -- Implemented the --without=package option for configure.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see man appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 -- New configuration parameter NodeFeaturesPlugins added.
 -- Change default CgroupMountpoint (in cgroup.conf) from "/cgroup" to
    "/sys/fs/cgroup" to match current standard.
 -- Introduce a new parameter "requeue_setup_env_fail" in SchedulerParameters.
    If set, a job that fails to setup the environment will be requeued and the
    node drained.
 -- The partition-specific SelectTypeParameters parameter can now be used to
    change the memory allocation tracking specification in the global
    SelectTypeParameters configuration parameter. Supported partition-specific
    values are CR_Core, CR_Core_Memory, CR_Socket and CR_Socket_Memory. If the
    global SelectTypeParameters value includes memory allocation management and
    the partition-specific value does not, then memory allocation management for
    that partition will NOT be supported (i.e. memory can be over-allocated).
    Likewise the global SelectTypeParameters might not include memory management
    while the partition-specific value does.
 -- Split partition's "Priority" field into "PriorityTier" (used to order
    partitions for scheduling and preemption) plus "PriorityJobFactor" (used by
    priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority, which is used to
    order jobs within a partition for scheduling). If only "Priority" is
    specified, that value will be used for both the "PriorityTier" and
    "PriorityJobFactor" value.
 -- New configuration file "knl.conf" added specifically for Intel Knights
    Landing processor support.
 -- Make it so jobs/steps track ':' named gres/tres, before hand gres/gpu:tesla
    would only track gres/gpu, now it will track both gres/gpu and
    gres/gpu:tesla as separate gres if configured like
    AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu,gres/gpu:tesla
 -- Add TCPTimeout option to slurm[dbd].conf. Decouples MessageTimeout from TCP
    connections.
 -- Added SchedulingParameters option of "bf_min_prio_reserve". Jobs below
    the specified threshold will not have resources reserved for them.
 -- Add SchedulerParameter "no_env_cache", if set no environment cache will be
    used when launching a job, instead the job will fail and drain the node if
    the environment isn't loaded normally.
 -- Remove the SchedulerParameters option of "assoc_limit_continue", making it
    the default value. Add option of "assoc_limit_stop". If "assoc_limit_stop"
    is set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not attempt
    to initiate any lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can
    decrease system throughput and utlization, but avoid potentially starving
    larger jobs by preventing them from launching indefinitely.
 -- Rename partition configuration from "Shared" to "OverSubscribe". Rename
    salloc, sbatch, srun option from "--shared" to "--oversubscribe". The old
    options will continue to function. Output field names also changed in
    scontrol, sinfo, squeue and sview.
 -- Add TopologyParam option of "TopoOptional" to optimize network topology
    only for jobs requesting it.
 -- Configuration parameter "CpuFreqDef" used to set default governor for job
    step not specifying --cpu-freq (previously the parameter was unused)
 -- Use TaskPluginParam for default task binding if no user specified CPU
    binding. User --cpu_bind option takes precident over default. No longer
    any error if user --cpu_bind option does not match TaskPluginParam.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- sbatch to read OpenLava/LSF/#BSUB options from the batch script.
 -- Add sbatch "--wait" option that waits for job completion before exiting.
    Exit code will match that of spawned job.
 -- Job output and error files can now contain "%" character by specifying
    a file name with two consecutive "%" characters. For example,
    "sbatch -o "slurm.%%.%j" for job ID 123 will generate an output file named
    "slurm.%.123".
 -- Increase default sbcast buffer size from 512KB to 8MB.
 -- Add "ValidateTimeout" and "OtherTimeout" to "scontrol show burst" output.
 -- Implemented the checking configuration functionality using the new -C
    options of slurmctld. To check for configuration errors in slurm.conf
    run: 'slurmctld -C'.
 -- Burst buffer advanced reservation units treated as bytes (per documentation)
    rather than GB.
 -- Add "features_act" field (currently active features) to the node
    information. Output of scontrol, sinfo, and sview changed accordingly.
    The field previously displayed as "Features" is now "AvailableFeatures"
    while the new field is displayed as "ActiveFeatures".
 -- Enable sbcast data compression logic (compress option previously ignored).
 -- Add --compress option to srun command for use with --bcast option.
 -- Added "sacctmgr show lostjobs" to report any orphaned jobs in the database.
 -- Add reservation flag of "purge_comp" which will purge an advanced
    reservation once it has no more active (pending, suspended or running) jobs.
 -- Add ARRAY_TASKS mail option to send emails to each task in a job array.

OTHER CHANGES
=============
 -- Add mail wrapper script "smail" that will include job statistics in email
    notification messages.
 -- Removed support for authd. authd has not been developed and supported since
    several years.
 -- Enable the hdf5 profiling of the batch step.
 -- Eliminate redundant environment and script files for job arrays. This
    greatly reduces the number of files involved in managing job arrays.
 -- Burst buffer/cray - Add support for multiple buffer pools including support
    for different resource granularity by pool.
 -- Stop searching sbatch scripts for #PBS directives after 100 lines of
    non-comments. Stop parsing #PBS or #SLURM directives after 1024 characters
    into a line. Required for decent perforamnce with huge scripts.
 -- New node features plugin infrastructure added. Currently used for support
    of Intel Knights Landing processor.
 -- If NodeHealthCheckProgram configured HealthCheckInterval is non-zero, then
    modify slurmd to run it before registering with slurmctld.
 -- select/cray - Initiate step node health check at start of step termination
    rather than after application completely ends so that NHC can capture
    information about hung (non-killable) processes.
