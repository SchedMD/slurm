RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 17.02
23 February 2017

IMPORTANT NOTES:
THE MAXJOBID IS NOW 67,108,863. ANY PRE-EXISTING JOBS WILL CONTINUE TO RUN BUT
NEW JOB IDS WILL BE WITHIN THE NEW MAXJOBID RANGE. Adjust your configured
MaxJobID value as needed to eliminate any confusion.

If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 17.02 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 15.08 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysqld. The
buffer pool size must be smaller than the size of the MySQL tmpdir. This is
needed when converting large tables over to the new database schema.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 15.08 or 16.05 to version 17.02 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

If using SPANK plugins that use the Slurm APIs, they should be recompiled when
upgrading Slurm to a new major release.

NOTE: systemd services files are installed automatically, but not enabled.
      You will need to manually enable them on the appropriate systems:
      - Controller: systemctl enable slurmctld
      - Database: systemctl enable slurmdbd
      - Compute Nodes: systemctl enable slurmd

NOTE: If you are not using Munge, but are using the "service" scripts to
      start Slurm daemons, then you will need to remove this check from the
      etc/slurm*service scripts.

NOTE: If you are upgrading with any jobs from 14.03 or earlier
      (i.e. quick upgrade from 14.03 -> 15.08 -> 17.02) you will need
      to wait until after those jobs are gone before you upgrade to 17.02.

NOTE: If you interact with any memory values in a job_submit plugin, you will
      need to test against NO_VAL64 instead of NO_VAL, and change your printf
      format as well.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- Added infrastructure for managing workload across a federation of clusters.
    (partial functionality in version 17.02, fully operational in May 2017)
 -- In order to support federated jobs, the MaxJobID configuration parameter
    default value has been reduced from 2,147,418,112 to 67,043,328 and its
    maximum value is now 67,108,863. Upon upgrading, any pre-existing jobs that
    have a job ID above the new range will continue to run and new jobs will get
    job IDs in the new range.
 -- Added "MailDomain" configuration parameter to qualify email addresses.
 -- Automatically clean up task/cgroup cpuset and devices cgroups after steps
    are completed.
 -- Added burst buffer support for job arrays. Added new SchedulerParameters
    configuration parameter of bb_array_stage_cnt=# to indicate how many pending
    tasks of a job array should be made available for burst buffer resource
    allocation.
 -- Added new sacctmgr commands: "shutdown" (shutdown the server), "list stats"
    (get server statistics) "clear stats" (clear server statistics).
 -- The database index for jobs is now 64 bits.  If you happen to be close to
    4 billion jobs in your database you will want to update your slurmctld at
    the same time as your slurmdbd to prevent roll over of this variable as
    it is 32 bit previous versions of Slurm.
 -- All memory values (in MB) are now 64 bit. Previously, nodes with more than
    of memory would not schedule or enforce memory limits correctly.
 -- Removed AIX, BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P support.
 -- Removed sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 plugins and associated code.
 -- Added PrologFlags=Serial to disable concurrent execution of prolog/epilog
    scripts.

RPMBUILD CHANGES
================
 -- Removed separate slurm_blcr package. If Slurm is built with BLCR support,
    the files will now be part of the main Slurm packages.
 -- Replace sjstat, seff and sjobexit RPM packages with a single "contribs"
    package.
 -- Prevent installation of both init scripts and systemd service files.
    Note that systemd services are not automatically enabled at this time,
    unlike the init scripts which were automatically enabled with chkconfig.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see man appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 -- Added new "TRESWeights" configuration parameter to "NodeName" line for
    calculating how busy a node is. Currently only used for federation
    configurations.
 -- Added new "PriorityFlags" option of "INCR_ONLY", which prevents a job's
    priority from being decremented.
 -- Added "SchedulerParameters" configuration parameter of "default_gbytes",
    which treats numeric only (no suffix) value for memory and tmp disk space as
    being in units of Gigabytes. Mostly for compatability with LSF.
 -- Added "BootTime" configuration parameter to knl.conf file to optimize
    resource allocations with respect to required node reboots.
 -- Added "SchedulingParameters" option of "bf_job_part_count_reserve". Jobs
    below the specified threshold will not have resources reserved for them.
 -- Added "SchedulerParameters" option of "spec_cores_first" to select
    specialized cores from the lowest rather than highest number cores and
    sockets.
 -- Added "PrologFlags" option of "Serial" to disable concurrent launch of
    Prolog and Epilog scripts.
 -- Removed "SchedulerRootFilter" configuration parameter.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- Added commands to sacctmgr for managing and displaying federations.
 -- Added salloc, sbatch and srun option of "--delay-boot=<time>", which will
    temporarily delay booting nodes into the desired state for a job in the
    hope of using nodes already in the proper state which will be available at
    a later time.
 -- Added salloc/sbatch/srun "--spread-job" option to distribute tasks over as
    many nodes as possible. This also treats the "--ntasks-per-node" option as a
    maximum value.
 -- Added support for sbatch --bbf option to specify a burst buffer input file.
 -- Added SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT environment variable. Total number of tasks in
    a job array (e.g. "--array=2,4,8" will set SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT=3).
 -- Modify cpu_bind and mem_bind map and mask options to accept a repetition
    count to better support large task count. For example:
    "mask_mem:0x0f*2,0xf0*2" is equivalent to "mask_mem:0x0f,0x0f,0xf0,0xf0".
 -- Added support for "--mem_bind=prefer" option to prefer, but not restrict
    memory use to the identified NUMA node.
 -- Added "--mem_bind=sort" option to run zonesort on KNL nodes at step start.
 -- Do not process SALLOC_HINT, SBATCH_HINT or SLURM_HINT environment variables
    if any of the following salloc, sbatch or srun command line options are
    specified: -B, --cpu_bind, --hint, --ntasks-per-core, or --threads-per-core.
 -- Added port info to "sinfo" and "scontrol show node" output.
 -- Move BatchScript to end of each job's information when using
    "scontrol -dd show job" to make it more readable.
 -- The scancel command would treat a non-numeric argument as the name of jobs
    to be cancelled (a non-documented feature). Cancelling jobs by name now
    require the "--jobname=" command line argument.
 -- If GRES are configured with file IDs, then "scontrol -d show node" will
    not only identify the count of currently allocated GRES, but their specific
    index numbers (e.g. "GresUsed=gpu:alpha:2(IDX:0,2),gpu:beta:0(IDX:N/A)").
    Ditto for job information with "scontrol -d show job".
 -- Added "GresEnforceBind=Yes" to "scontrol show job" output if so configured.
 -- Added "Partitions" field to "scontrol show node" output.

OTHER CHANGES
=============
 -- Added event trigger on burst buffer errors (see strigger man page,
    "--burst_buffer" option).
 -- Added job AdminComment field which can only be set by a Slurm administrator.
 -- Added mechanism to constrain kernel memory allocation using cgroups. New
    cgroup.conf parameters added: ConstrainKmemSpace, MaxKmemPercent, and
    MinKmemSpace.
 -- burst_buffer/cray: Accept new jobs on backup slurmctld daemon without access
    to dw_wlm_cli command. No burst buffer actions will take place.
 -- node_features/knl_cray and knl_generic - Added capability to detected
    Uncorrectable Memory Errors (UME) and if detected then log the event in all
    job and step stderr with a message of the form:
    error: *** STEP 1.2 ON tux1 UNCORRECTABLE MEMORY ERROR AT 2016-12-14T09:09:37 ***
 -- If job is allocated nodes which are powered down, then reset job start time
    when the nodes are ready and do not charge the job for power up time.
 -- Added the ability to purge transactions from the database.
 -- Added the ability to purge rolled up usage from the database.
 -- Added new mcs/account plugin.
 -- job_submit/lua - remove access to internal reservation job_run_cnt and
    job_pend_cnt fields.
 -- Increased maximum file size supported by sbcast from 2 GB (32-bit integer
    to 64-bits).
