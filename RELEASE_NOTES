RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 23.02

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 23.02 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 21.08 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 21.08 or 22.05 to version 23.02 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

All SPANK plugins must be recompiled when upgrading from any Slurm version
prior to 23.02.

NOTE: PMIx v1.x is no longer supported.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- Make scontrol reconfigure and sending a SIGHUP to the slurmctld behave the
    same. If you were using SIGHUP as a 'lighter' scontrol reconfigure to rotate
    logs please update your scripts to use SIGUSR2 instead.
 -- burst_buffer/lua - pass the job's UID and GID to slurm_bb_pre_run,
    slurm_bb_data_in, slurm_bb_post_run, and slurm_bb_data_out in
    burst_buffer.lua.
 -- Change cloud nodes to show by default. PrivateData=cloud is no longer
    needed.
 -- sreport - Count planned (FKA reserved) time for jobs running in IGNORE_JOBS
    reservations. Previously was lumped into IDLE time.
 -- job_container/tmpfs - Support running with an arbitrary list of private
    mount points (/tmp and /dev/shm are the default, but not required).
 -- job_container/tmpfs - Set more environment variables in InitScript.
 -- Make all cgroup directories created by Slurm owned by root. This was the
    behavior in cgroup/v2 but not in cgroup/v1 where by default the step
    directories ownership were set to the user and group of the job.
 -- accounting_storage/mysql - change purge/archive to calculate record ages
    based on end time, rather than start or submission times.
 -- job_submit/lua - add support for log_user() from slurm_job_modify().
 -- Run the following scripts in slurmscriptd instead of slurmctld:
    ResumeProgram, ResumeFailProgram, SuspendProgram, ResvProlog, ResvEpilog,
    and RebootProgram (only with SlurmctldParameters=reboot_from_controller).
 -- Only permit changing log levels with 'srun --slurmd-debug' by root
    or SlurmUser.
 -- slurmctld will fatal() when reconfiguring the job_submit plugin fails.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 -- job_container.conf - Added "Dirs" option to list desired private mount
    points.
 -- node_features plugins - invalid users specified for AllowUserBoot will now
    result in fatal() rather than just an error.
 -- Deprecate AllowedKmemSpace, ConstrainKmemSpace, MaxKmemPercent, and
    MinKmemSpace.
 -- Allow jobs to queue even if the user is not in AllowGroups when
    EnforcePartLimits=no is set. This ensures consistency for all the Partition
    access controls, and matches the documented behavior for EnforcePartLimits.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- sacctmgr - no longer force updates to the AdminComment, Comment, or
    SystemComment to lower-case.
 -- sinfo - Add -F/--future option to sinfo to display future nodes.
 -- sacct - Rename 'Reserved' field to 'Planned' to match sreport and the
    nomenclature of the 'Planned' node.
 -- scontrol - advanced reservation flag MAINT will no longer replace nodes,
    similar to STATIC_ALLOC
 -- sbatch - add parsing for #PBS -d and #PBS -w.
 -- scontrol show assoc_mgr will show username(uid) instead of uid in
    QoS section.
 -- Add strigger --draining and -R/--resume options.
 -- Change --oversubscribe and --exclusive to be mutually exclusive for job
    submission. Job submission commands will now fatal if both are set.
    Previously, these options would override each other, with the last one in
    the job submission command taking effect.
 -- scontrol - Requested TRES and allocated TRES will now always be printed when
    showing jobs, instead of one TRES output that was either the requested or
    allocated.
 -- srun --ntasks-per-core now applies to job and step allocations. Now, use of
    --ntasks-per-core=1 implies --cpu-bind=cores and --ntasks-per-core>1 implies
    --cpu-bind=threads.
 -- salloc/sbatch/srun - Check and abort if ntasks-per-core > threads-per-core.

API CHANGES
===========
 -- job_container plugins - container_p_stepd_create() function signature
    replaced uint32_t uid with stepd_step_rec_t* step.
 -- gres plugins - gres_g_get_devices() function signature replaced pid_t pid
    with stepd_step_rec_t* step.
 -- cgroup plugins - task_cgroup_devices_constrain() function signature removed
    pid_t pid.
 -- task plugins - replace task_p_pre_set_affinity(), task_p_set_affinity(), and
    task_p_post_set_affinity() with task_p_pre_launch_priv() like it was back in
    slurm 20.11.
 -- Allow for concurrent processing of job_submit_g_submit() and
    job_submit_g_modify() calls. If your plugin is not capable of concurrent
    operation you must add additional locking within your plugin.
 -- burst buffer plugins - add bb_g_build_het_job_script().
 -- Removed return value from slurm_list_append().
