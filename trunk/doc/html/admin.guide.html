<h1>SLURM Administrator's Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
scheduling system for Linux clusters having 
thousands of nodes.  Components include machine status, partition
management, job management, and scheduling modules.  The design also 
includes a scalable, general-purpose communication infrastructure.
SLURM requires no kernel modifications and is relatively self-contained. 
There is a "control" machine, which orchestrates SLURM activities. A "backup 
controller" is also desirable to assume control functions in the event 
of a failure in the control machine. There are also compute servers on 
which applications execute, which can number in the thousands.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
There a single SLURM configuration file containing: 
overall SLURM options, node configurations, and partition configuration. 
This file is located at "/etc/SLURM.conf" by default.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the 
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter.
The overall SLURM configuration options specify the control and backup 
control machines. 
The locations of daemons, state information storage, and other details 
are specified at build time. 
See the <a href="#Build">Build Parameters</a> section for details. 
The node configuration tell SLURM what nodes it is to manage as well as 
their expected configuration. 
The partition configuration permits you to define sets (or partitions) 
of nodes and establish distinct job limits or access control for them. 
Configuration information may be read or updated using SLURM APIs.
This configuration file or a copy of it must be accessible on every computer under 
SLURM management. 
<p>
The following parameters may be specified:
<dl>
<dt>ControlMachine
<dd>The name of the machine where SLURM control functions are executed 
(e.g. "lx01"). This value must be specified.

<dt>BackupController
<dd>The name of the machine where SLURM control functions are to be 
executed in the event that ControlMachine fails (e.g. "lx02"). This node
may also be used as a compute server if so desired. It will come into service 
as a controller only upon the failure of ControlMachine and will revert 
to a "standby" mode when the ControlMachine becomes available once again. 
While not essential, it is highly recommended that you specify a backup 
controller.
</dl>
Any text after "#" until the old of the line in the configuration file 
will be considered a comment. 
If you need to use "#" in a value within the configuration file, proceed 
it with backslash "\").
The configuration file should contain a keyword followed by an 
equal sign, followed by the value. 
Keyword value pairs should be separated from each other by white space. 
The field descriptor keywords are case sensitive. 
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters. 
A sample SLURM configuration file (without node or partition information)
follows.
<pre>
# /etc/SLURM.conf
# Built by John Doe, 1/29/2002
ControlMachine=lx01
BackupController=lx02
</pre>
<p>
The node configuration permits you to identify the nodes (or machines) 
to be managed by SLURM. You may also identify the 
characteristics of the node in the configuration file. SLURM operates 
in a heterogeneous environment and users are able to specify resource 
requirements for each job 
The node configuration specifies the following information: 
<dl>

<dt>NodeName
<dd>Name of a node as returned by hostname (e.g. "lx12"). 
<a name="NodeExp">A simple real expression may optionally be used to specify ranges 
of nodes to avoid building a configuration file with thousands 
of entries. The real expression can contain one  
pair of square brackets optionally followed by "o"
for octal (the default is decimal) followed by 
a number followed by a "-" followed by another number. 
SLURM considers every number in the specified range to 
identify a valid node. Some possible NodeName values include:
"solo", "lx[00-64]", "linux[0-64]", and "slurm[o00-77]".</a> 
If the NodeName is "DEFAULT", the values specified 
with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications   
unless explicitly set to other values in that node record or 
replaced with a different set of default values. 
For architectures in which the node order is significant, 
nodes will be considered consecutive in the order defined. 
For example, if the configuration for NodeName=charlie immediately 
follows the configuration for NodeName=baker they will be 
considered adjacent in the computer.

<dt>CPUs
<dd>Number of processors on the node (e.g. "2"). The default 
value is 1.

<dt>RealMemory
<dd>Size of real memory on the node in MegaBytes (e.g. "2048").
The default value is 1.

<dt>TmpDisk
<dd>Total size of temporary disk storage in TMP_FS in MegaBytes 
(e.g. "16384"). TMP_FS (for "Temporary File System") 
identifies the location which jobs should use for temporary storage. The
value of TMP_FS is set at SLURM build time. 
Note this does not indicate the amount of free 
space available to the user on the node, only the total file 
system size. The system administration should insure this file 
system is purged as needed so that user jobs have access to 
most of this space. 
The PROLOG and/or EPILOG files (specified at build time) might 
be used to insure the file system is kept clean. 
The default value is 1.

<dt>State
<dd>State of the node with respect to the initiation of user jobs. 
Acceptable values are "UNKNOWN", "IDLE", "BUSY", "DOWN", "DRAINED", 
"DRAINING". For example, the SLURM control machine may very well 
not be used for initiation of user jobs and its state could thus 
be set to "DRAINED". The default value is "UNKNOWN".

</dl>
<p>
Only the NodeName must be supplied in the configuration file; all other 
items are optional.
Other configuration information can be gathered through communications 
with the SLURM Daemon, slurmd actually running on each node.
Alternately, you can explicitly establish baseline values in the 
configuration file. 
Nodes which register to the system with less than the configured resources 
(e.g. too little memory), will be placed in the "DOWN" state to 
avoid scheduling jobs on them. 
The resources checked at node registration time are: CPUs, 
RealMemory and TmpDisk. 
The default values for each node can be specified with a record in which 
"NodeName" is "DEFAULT". 
The "NodeName="  specification must be placed on every line 
describing the configuration of that node(s). 
When a NodeName specification exists on two or more separate lines 
in the configuration, only values specified in the second 
or subsequent lines will be set (SLURM will not re-apply default values).
All required information can typically be placed on a single line.
The field descriptors above are case sensitive. 
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the 
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times 
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "NodeName=DEFAULT".
In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes
on some architectures, 
node specifications should be place in this file in consecutive order.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
<p>
The node states have the following meanings:
<dl>
<dt>UNKNOWN
<dd>Default initial node state upon startup of SLURM.
An attempt will be made to contact the node and acquire current state information.

<dt>IDLE
<dd>The node is idle and available for use.

<dt>BUSY
<dd>The node has been allocated work (one or more user jobs) and is 
processing it. 

<dt>DOWN
<dd>The node is unavailable for use. It has been explicitly configured 
DOWN or failed to respond to system state inquiries or has 
explicitly removed itself from service due to a failure. This state 
typically indicates some problem requiring administrator intervention.

<dt>DRAINING
<dd>The node has been made unavailable for new work by explicit administrator 
intervention. It is processing some work at present and will enter state
"DRAINED" when that work has been completed. This might be used to 
prepare some nodes for maintenance work.

<dt>DRAINED
<dd>The node is idle, but not available for use. The state of a node 
will automatically change from DRAINING to DRAINED when user job(s) executing 
on that node terminate. Since this state is entered by explicit 
administrator request, additional SLURM administrator intervention is typically 
not required.
</dl>
<p>
SLURM uses a hash table in order to locate table entries rapidly. 
Each table entry can be directly accessed without any searching
if the name contains a sequence number suffix. SLURM can be built 
with the HASH_BASE set at build time to indicate the hashing algorithm. 
Possible contains values are "10" and "8" for names containing 
decimal and octal sequence numbers respectively
or "0" which processes mixed alpha-numeric without sequence numbers. 
If you use a naming convention lacking a sequence number, it may be 
desirable to review the hashing function Hash_Index in the 
Mach_Stat_Mgr.c module. This is especially important in clusters having 
large numbers of nodes.  The sequence numbers can start at any 
desired number, but should contain consecutive numbers. The 
sequence number portion may contain leading zeros for a consistent 
name length, if so desired. Note that correct operation 
will be provided with any nodes names, but performance will suffer 
without this optimization.
A sample SLURM configuration file (node information only) follows.
<pre>
# Node specifications
NodeName=DEFAULT   CPUs=16 RealMemory=2048 TmpDisk=16384
NodeName=lx[01-02] State=DRAINED
NodeName=lx[03-16]
NodeName=lx[17-32] CPUs=32 RealMemory=4096
</pre>
<p>
The partition configuration permits you to establish different job 
limits or access controls for various groups (or partitions) of nodes. 
Nodes may be in more than one partition. The partition configuration 
file contains the following information: 
<dl>
<dt>PartitionName
<dd>Name by which the partition may be referenced (e.g. "Interactive"). 
This name can be specified by users when submitting jobs.

<dt>MaxTime
<dd>Maximum wall-time limit for any job in minutes. The default 
value is "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.

<dt>MaxNodes
<dd>Maximum count of nodes which may be allocated to any single job,
The default value is "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.

<dt>State
<dd>State of partition or availability for use.  Possible values 
are "UP" or "DOWN". The default value is "UP".

<dt>RootKey
<dd>If this keyword is set, the job must be submitted with a 
valid "Key=value" specified. 
Valid key values are provided to user <b>root</b> upon request. 
This mechanism can be used to restrict access to a partition. 
For example, a batch system might execute as root, acquire 
a key via the SLURM API, then set its user ID to that of a 
non-privileged user and initiate his job. 
The user's job has no special privileges other than access 
to the partition.
The non-privileged user would not be able to submit jobs 
directly to this partition for lack of a key.
Issued keys will remain valid for a single use only.

<dt>AllowGroups
<dd>Comma separated list of group IDs which may use the partition. 
If at least one group associated with the user submitting the 
job is in AllowGroups, he will be permitted to use this partition.
The default value is "ALL". 

<dt>Nodes
<dd>Comma separated list of nodes which are associated with this 
partition. Node names may be specified using the <a href="#NodeExp">
real expression syntax</a> described above. A blank list of nodes 
(i.e. "Nodes= ") can be used if one wants a partition to exist, 
but have no resources (possibly on a temporary basis).

<dt>Shared
<dd>Specify if more than one job may execute on each node in 
a partition simultaneously. Possible values are 
"YES" and "NO". The default value is "NO". 
If nodes are shared, job performance will vary.
</dl>
<p>
Only the PartitionName must be supplied in the configuration file.
It is recommended that configuration file contain information 
about one partition per line. If more than one line is used to 
describe the configuration of a partition, specify the "PartitionName=" 
on each line.
The field descriptors above are case sensitive. 
The default values for each partition can be specified with a record in which 
"PartitionName" is "DEFAULT" if other default values are desired. 
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the 
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times 
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "PartitionName=DEFAULT". 
When a PartitionName specification exists on two separate lines 
in the configuration, only values explicitly set in the second 
or subsequent lines will be set (SLURM will not re-apply default values).
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
A sample SLURM configuration file (partition information only) follows.
<p>
A single job may be allocated nodes from more than one partition if the 
job satisfies the configuration specifications from all partitions used. 
<i>We could restrict jobs to use of a single partition, but this could 
reduce flexibility in scheduling. - Moe</i> 
The job may specify a particular PartitionName, if so desired.
<pre>
# Partition specifications
PartitionName=batch MaxNodes=10        MaxTime=UNLIMITED Nodes=lx[10-30] RootKey
PartitionName=debug MaxNodes=2         MaxTime=60        Nodes=lx[03-09]
PartitionName=super MaxNodes=UNLIMITED MaxTime=UNLIMITED Nodes=lx[03-32] AllowGroups=dunlap,garlick,grondo,jette
PartitionName=class MaxNodes=1         MaxTime=10        Nodes=lx[31-32] AllowGroups=students
</pre>
<p>
Several sets of system configurations may be placed into a single 
SLURM configuration file with associated names. 
For example, one might establish a "night" and "weekend" 
configuration. 
One should establish a default configuration to be used 
when SLURM is initialized. 
The named configurations may be used when explicitly 
requested using the slurm_admin tool described below.
Named configurations are followed by a set of applicable 
configuration parameters to be applied enclosed within 
braces "{}".
<i>I am not entirely happy with this. It seems we would need 
to specify time ranges, day of week ranges, holiday flags, etc. 
It would seem simpler to specify a general partition configuration 
in the file and use CRON to make changes. For example, we could 
create a PartitionName=class with State=DOWN and change the State 
as desired. - Moe</i>
A <a href="#SampleConfig">SLURM configuration file</a> is included at the end of this document.

<h3>Job Configuration</h3>
The job configuration format specified below is used by the 
slurm_admin administration tool to modify job state information: 
<dl>

<dt>Number
<dd>Unique number by which the job can be referenced. This value 
may not be changed by slurm_admin.

<dt>Name
<dd>Name by which the job may be referenced (e.g. "Simulation"). 
This name can be specified by users when submitting their jobs.

<dt>MaxTime
<dd>Maximum wall-time limit for the job in minutes. An "UNLIMITED"
value is represented internally as -1.

<dt>Nodes
<dd>Comma separated list of nodes which are allocated to the job. 
This value may not be changed by slurm_admin.

<dt>State
<dd>State of the job.  Possible values are "PENDING", "STARTING", 
"RUNNING", and "ENDING". 

<dt>User
<dd>Name of the user executing this job.

</dl>

<a name="Build"><h2>Build Parameters</h2></a>
The following configuration parameters are established at SLURM build time. 
State and configuration information may be read or updated using SLURM APIs.

<dl>
<dt>BACKUP_INTERVAL
<dd>How long to wait between saving SLURM state. The default 
value is 60 and the units are seconds.

<dt>BACKUP_LOCATION
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file where the SLURM 
state information is saved. There is no default value. The file should 
be accessible to both the ControlMachine and also the BackupController.
The default value is "/usr/local/SLURM/Slurm.state".

<dt>CONTROL_DAEMON
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file containing the SLURM daemon
to execute on the ControlMachine. The default value is "/usr/local/SLURM/bin/Slurmd.Control".
This file must be accessible to the ControlMachine and BackupController.

<dt>CONTROLLER_TIMEOUT
<dd>How long the BackupController waits for the CONTROL_DAEMON to respond 
before assuming it has failed and starting the BackupController. 
The default value is 300 and the units are seconds.

<dt>EPILOG
<dd>This program is executed on each node allocated to a job upon its termination. 
This can be used to remove temporary files created by the job or other clean-up.
This file must be accessible to every SLURM compute server. 
By default there is no epilog program. 

<dt>HASH_BASE
<dd>SLURM uses a hash table in order to locate table entries rapidly. 
Each table entry can be directly accessed without any searching
if the name contains a sequence number suffix. SLURM can be built 
with the HASH_BASE set to indicate the hashing mechanism. Possible 
values are "10" and "8" for names containing  
decimal and octal sequence numbers respectively
or "0" which processes mixed alpha-numeric without sequence numbers. 
If you use a naming convention lacking a sequence number, it may be 
desirable to review the hashing function Hash_Index in the 
Mach_Stat_Mgr.c module. This is especially important in clusters having 
large numbers of nodes.  The default value is "10".

<dt>HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL
<dd>How frequently each SERVER_DAEMON should report its state to the CONTROL_DAEMON. 
Also, how frequently the CONTROL_DAEMON should report its state to the BackupController. 
The default value is 60 and the units are seconds.

<dt>INIT_PROGRAM
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of a program that must execute and 
return an exit code of zero before the CONTROL_DAEMON or SERVER_DAEMON 
enter into service. This would normally be used to insure that the 
computer is fully ready for executing user jobs. It may, for example, 
wait until every required file system has been mounted.
By default there is no initialization program.

<dt>KILL_WAIT
<dd>How long to wait between sending SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals to jobs at termination time.
The default value is 60 and the units are seconds.

<dt>PROLOG
<dd>This program is executed on each node allocated to a job prior to its initiation. 
This file must be accessible to every SLURM compute server. By default no prolog is executed. 

<dt>SERVER_DAEMON
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file containing the SLURM daemon
to execute on every compute server node. The default value is "/usr/local/SLURM/bin/Slurmd.Server".
This file must be accessible to every SLURM compute server.

<dt>SERVER_TIMEOUT
<dd>How long the CONTROL_DAEMON waits for the SERVER_DAEMON to respond before assuming it 
has failed and declaring the node DOWN then terminating any job running on 
it. The default value is 300 and the units are seconds.

<dt>SLURM_CONF
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file containing the SLURM 
configuration file. The default value is "/etc/SLURM.conf".

<dt>TMP_FS 
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file system which jobs should use for 
temporary storage. The default value is "/tmp".
</dl>

<h2>Slurm_admin Administration Tool</h2>
The tool you will primarily use in the administration of SLURM is slurm_admin. 
It provides the means of viewing and updating node and partition 
configurations. It can also be used to update some job state 
information. You can execute slurm_admin with a single keyword on 
the execute line or it will query you for input and process those 
keywords on an interactive basis. The slurm_admin keywords are shown below.
A <a href="#SampleAdmin">sample slurm_admin session</a> with examples is appended.

<p>
Usage: slurm_admin [-q | -v] [&lt;keyword&gt;]<br>
-q is equivalent to the "quiet" keyword<br>
-v is equivalent to the "verbose" keyword<br>
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>exit
<dd>Terminate slurm_admin.

<dt>help
<dd>Display this list of slurm_admin commands and options.

<dt>quiet
<dd>Print no messages other than error messages.

<dt>quit
<dd>Terminate slurm_admin.

<dt>reconfigure [&lt;NodeName&gt;]
<dd>The SLURM daemons on the specified node are instructed to re-read 
the configuration files. The default is that all daemons on all nodes 
are reconfigured.

<dt>show &lt;entity&gt; [&lt;ID&gt;]
<dd>Show the configuration for a given entity. Entity must 
be "job", "node", or "partition". By default, state information 
for all records is reported. If you only wish to see the 
state of one entity record, specify either its ID number
(assumed if entirely numeric) or its name. 

<dt>update &lt;options&gt;
<dd>Update the configuration information. 
Options are of the same format as the configuration file. 
This command can only be issued by user <b>root</b>.

<dt>upload [&lt;NodeName&gt;]
<dd>Upload into the SLURM node configuration table actual configuration 
as actually reported by SERVER_DAEMON on each node (memory, CPU count, temporary disk, etc.).
This could be used to establish a baseline configuration rather than 
entering the configurations manually into a file. 
By default information from all nodes is uploaded. 
This command can only be issued by user <b>root</b>.

<dt>verbose
<dd>Enable detailed logging of slurm_admin execution state information.

<dt>version
<dd>Display the slurm_admin tool version number.

<dt>write &lt;filename&gt;
<dd>Write current configuration information to the specified file. 
This file can subsequently be used as a SLURM configuration file. 
This file can be quite verbose as regular expressions will not be 
used for node identification. (To do: add regular expressions) 
</dl>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
There is no necessity for synchronized clocks on the nodes. 
Events occur either in real-time based upon message traffic 
or based upon changes in the time on a node. However, synchronized 
clocks will permit easier analysis of SLURM logs from multiple 
nodes.
<p>
SLURM uses the syslog function to record events. It uses a 
range of importance levels for these messages. Be certain
that your system's syslog functionality is operational.
