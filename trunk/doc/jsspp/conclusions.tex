\section{Conclusion and Future Plans}

We have presented in this paper an overview of SLURM, a simple, highly scalable, robust,
and portable cluster resource management system.
The contribution of this work is that we have provided a immediately-available
and open-source tool that virtually anybody can use to efficiently manage clusters of
different sizes and architecture.
%We expect SLURM to begin production use on LLNL Linux clusters
%starting in March 2003 and be available for distribution shortly
%thereafter.

Looking ahead, we anticipate adding support for additional
operating systems.
% (IA64 and x86-64) and interconnects (InfiniBand
%and the IBM Blue Gene\cite{BlueGene2002} system\footnote{Blue Gene
%has a different interconnect than any supported by SLURM and
%a 3-D topography with restrictive allocation constraints.}).
We anticipate adding a job preempt/resume capability, which will
provide an external scheduler the infrastructure
required to perform gang scheduling, and a checkpoint/restart capability.
We also plan to use the SLURM for IBM's Blue Gene/L platform~\cite{BGL} by incorporating a capability
to manage jobs on a three-dimensional torus machine into the SLURM.
