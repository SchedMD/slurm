REPORT DESCRIPTION
.RS
.TP
.B cluster AccountUtilizationByUser 
This report will display account utilization as it appears on the
hierarchical tree.  Starting with the specified account or the
root account by default this report will list the underlying
usage with a sum on each level.  Use the 'tree' option to span
the tree for better visibility.
.TP 
.B cluster UserUtilizationByAccount
This report will display users by account in order of utilization without
grouping multiple accounts by user into one, but displaying them
on separate lines.
.TP
.B cluster UserUtilizationByWCKey
This report will display users by wckey in order of utilization without
grouping multiple wckey by user into one, but displaying them
on separate lines.
.TP
.B cluster Utilization
This report will display total usage divided by Allocated, Down,
Idle, and Reserved time for selected clusters.  Reserved time
refers to time that a job was waiting for resources after the job
had become eligible.  If the value is not of importance for you
the number should be grouped with idle time.
.TP
.B cluster WCKeyUtilizationByUser
This report will display wckey utilization sorted by WCKey name for
each user on each cluster.  

.TP
.B job Sizes
This report will dispay the amount of time used for job ranges
specified by the 'grouping=' option.  Only a single level in the tree
is displayed defaulting to the root dir.  If you specify other
accounts with the 'account=' option sreport will use those accounts as
the root account and you will receive the sub accounts for the
accounts listed.

.TP
.B user TopUsage
Displays the top users on a cluster.  Use the group option to group
accounts together.  The default is to have a different line for each
user account combination.
