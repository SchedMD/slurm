\fBSPANK\fR \- SLURM Plug-in Architecture for Node and job (K)control 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual briefly describes the capabilities of the SLURM Plug-in
architecture for Node and job Kontrol (\fBSPANK\fR) as well as the \fBSPANK\fR
configuration file: (By default: \fBplugstack.conf\fP.)
.LP
\fBSPANK\fR provides a very generic interface for stackable plug-ins 
which may be used to dynamically modify the job launch code in
SLURM. \fBSPANK\fR plugins may be built without access to SLURM source
code. They need only be compiled against SLURM's \fBspank.h\fR header file,
added to the \fBSPANK\fR config file \fBplugstack.conf\fR,
and they will be loaded at runtime during the next job launch. Thus,
the \fBSPANK\fR infrastructure provides administrators and other developers
a low cost, low effort ability to dynamically modify the runtime
behavior of SLURM job launch.
.LP
\fBSPANK\fR plugins may be called from multiple points during the SLURM job
launch. A plugin may define the following functions:
.TP 2
\fBslurm_spank_init\fR 
Called just after job step is initialized.
.TP
\fBslurm_spank_user_init\fR 
Called after privileges are temporarily dropped.
.TP
\fBslurm_spank_task_init\fR 
Called for each task just before execve(2).
.TP
\fBslurm_spank_task_post_fork\fR 
Called for each task from parent process after fork(2) is complete.
Due to the fact that \fBslurmd\fR does not exec any tasks until all
tasks have completed fork(2), this call is guaranteed to run before
the user task is executed.
.TP
\fBslurm_spank_task_exit\fR
Called for each task as its exit status is collected by SLURM.
.TP
\fBslurm_spank_exit\fR
Called once just before \fBslurmstepd\fR exits.
.LP
All of these functions have the same prototype, for example:
.nf

   slurm_spank_init (spank_t spank, int ac, char *argv[])

.fi
.LP
Where \fBspank\fR is the \fBSPANK\fR handle which must be passed back to
SLURM when the plugin calls functions like \fBspank_get_item\fR and
\fBspank_getenv\fR. Configured arguments (See \fBCONFIGURATION\fR
below) are passed in the argument vector \fBargv\fR with argument
count \fBac\fR.
.LP
\fBSPANK\fR plugins do not have direct access to internally defined SLURM 
data structures. Instead, information about the currently executing
job is obtained via the \fBspank_get_item\fR function call.
.nf

  spank_err_t spank_get_item (spank_t spank, spank_item_t item, ...);

.fi
The \fBspank_get_item\fR call must be passed the current \fBSPANK\fR
handle as well as the item requested, which is defined by the
passed \fBspank_item_t\fR. A variable number of pointer arguments are also
passed, depending on which item was requested by the plugin. A
list of the valid values for \fBitem\fR is kept in the \fBspank.h\fR header
file. Some examples are:
.TP 2
\fBS_JOB_UID\fR
User id for running job. (uid_t *) is third arg of \fBspank_get_item\fR
.TP
\fBS_JOB_STEPID\fR
Job step id for running job. (uint32_t *) is third arg of \fBspank_get_item\fR
.TP
\fBS_TASK_EXIT_STATUS\fR
Exit status for exited task. Only valid from \fBslurm_spank_task_exit\fR.
(int *) is third arg of \fBspank_get_item\fR.
.TP
\fBS_JOB_ARGV\fR
Complete job command line. Third and fourth args to \fBspank_get_item\fR
are (int *, char ***).
.LP
See \fBspank.h\fR for more details, and \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for an example
of \fBspank_get_item\fR usage.
.LP
\fBSPANK\fR plugins may also use the \fBspank_getenv\fR and
\fBspank_setenv\fR functions to view and modify the job's
environment. \fBspank_getenv\fR searches the job's environment for
the environment variable \fIvar\fR and copies the current value
into a buffer \fIbuf\fR of length \fIlen\fR.  \fBspank_setenv\fR
allows a \fBSPANK\fR plugin to set or overwrite a variable in the job's
environment. The prototypes are:
.nf

 spank_err_t spank_getenv (spank_t spank, const char *var, 
		           char *buf, int len);
 spank_err_t spank_setenv (spank_t spank, const char *var, 
		           const char *val, int overwrite);
.fi
.LP
See \fBspank.h\fR for more information, and \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for an example
for \fBspank_getenv\fR usage.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.LP
The default \fBSPANK\fR plug-in stack configuration file is
\fBplugstack.conf\fR in the same directory as \fBslurm.conf\fR(5),
though this may be changed via the SLURM config parameter
\fIPlugStackConfig\fR. The config file lists \fBSPANK\fR plugins,
one per line, along with whether the plugin is \fIrequired\fR or
\fIoptional\fR, and any global arguments that are to be passed to
the plugin for runtime configuration.  Comments are preceded with '#' 
and extend to the end of the line.  If the configuration file
is missing or empty, it will simply be ignored.
.LP
The format of each non-comment line in the configuration file is:
\fB
.nf

  required/optional   plugin   arguments

.fi
\fR For example:
.nf

  optional /usr/lib/slurm/test.so

.fi
Tells \fBslurmd\fR to load the plugin \fBtest.so\fR passing no arguments.
If a \fBSPANK\fR plugin is \fIrequired\fR, then failure of any of the
plugin's functions will cause \fBslurmd\fR to terminate the job, while
\fIoptional\fR plugins only cause a warning.
.LP
\fBSPANK\fR plugins are stackable, meaning that more than one plugin may
be placed into the config file. The plugins will simply be called
in order, one after the other, and appropriate action taken on
failure given that state of the plugin's \fIoptional\fR flag.
.LP
The \fBSPANK\fR config file is re-read on each job launch, so editing
the config file will not affect running jobs. However care should
be taken so that a partially edited config file is not read by a
launching job.  
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP
Simple \fBSPANK\fR config file:
.nf

#
# SPANK config file
#
# required?       plugin                     args
#
optional          /usr/lib/slurm/renice.so   verbose
required          /usr/lib/slurm/test.so     

.fi
.LP
Simple \fBSPANK\fR plugin to modify job nice value. 
Allows priority to be set via SLURM_RENICE environment variable, 
though system-wide default could be set using \fBSPANK\fR plugin arguments
in the configuration file.
.nf

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>

#include <slurm/spank.h>

int slurm_spank_task_post_fork (spank_t sp, int ac, char **av)
{
        pid_t pid;
        int taskid;
        char buf [1024];
        long int prio;
        const char *var = "SLURM_RENICE";
        char *p;

        spank_get_item (sp, S_TASK_GLOBAL_ID, &taskid);
        spank_get_item (sp, S_TASK_PID, &pid);

        if (spank_getenv (sp, var, buf, 1024) != ESPANK_SUCCESS) {
                return (0);
        }

        prio = strtol (buf, &p, 10);
        if ((*p != '\0') || (prio < -20) || (prio > 20)) {
                slurm_error ("Bad value for %s: \"%s\"\n", var, buf);
                return (-1);
        }

        slurm_info ("re-nicing task%d pid %ld to %ld\n", 
                    taskid, pid, prio);

        if (setpriority (PRIO_PROCESS, (int) pid, (int) prio) < 0) {
                slurm_error ("setpriority: %m");
                return (-1);
        }

        return (0);
}
