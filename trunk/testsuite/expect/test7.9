# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test that no files are open in spawned tasks (except stdin,
#          stdout, and stderr) to insure successful checkpoint/restart.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
