# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test routing all signals through slurmctld rather than directly
#          to slurmd (undocumented --ctld option).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
