# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Validate scontrol exit, quit, and !! commands.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
#
# NOTE: The interaction processing is a bit strange to deal with the 
# behavior of readline() in RedHat 9, that keeps printing the prompt 
# for each keystroke.
