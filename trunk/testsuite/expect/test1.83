############################################################################
# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test of contiguous option with multiple nodes (--contiguous option).
#          Also see test1.14.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "WARNING: ..." with an explanation of why the test can't be made, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
#
# NOTE:    This assumes node names are of the form <alpha><number>, where 
#          the value of <number> indicates the nodes relative location. 
#          Change tha node name parsing logic as needed for other formats.
