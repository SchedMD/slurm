RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.2
17 February 2010 (through SLURM 2.2.0-pre1+)


IMPORTANT NOTE:
If using the slurmdbd (SLURM DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 2.2 slurmdbd will work with SLURM daemons of version 2.1.3 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference and restarting the mysqld.  This is needed when
converting large tables over to the new database schema.

SLURM can be upgraded from version 2.1 to version 2.2 without loss of jobs or
other state.


HIGHLIGHTS
* Slurmctld restart/reconfiguration operations have been altered.
  NOTE: There will be no change in behavior unless partition configuration
  or node Features/Weight are altered using the scontrol command to differ
  from the contents of the slurm.conf configuration file.

  Preserve current partition state information plus node Feature and Weight
  state information after slurmctld receives a SIGHUP signal or is restarted
  with the -R option. Recreate partition plus node information (except node
  State and Reason) from slurm.conf file after executing "scontrol reconfig"
  or restarting slurmctld *without* the -R option.

     OPERATION            ACTION
     slurmctld -R         Recover all job, node and partition state
     slurmctld            Recover job state, recreate node and partition state
     slurmctld -c         Recover no jobs, recreate node and partition state
     SIGHUP to slurmctld  Preserve all job, node and partition state
     scontrol reconfig    Preserve job state, recreate node and partition state

  Old logic preserved node Feature plus partition state after "slurmctld" or
  "scontrol reconfig" rather than recreating it from slurm.conf. Node Weight
  was formerly always recreated from slurm.conf.

* Support has been added for TotalView to attach to a subset of launched tasks
  instead of requiring that all tasks be attached to.

* A web application (chart_stats.cgi) has been added that invokes sreport to
  retrieve from the accounting storage db a user's request for job usage or
  machine utilization statistics and charts the results to a browser.

* A hash of the slurm.conf running on each node in the cluster is sent when
  registering with the slurmctld so it can verify the slurm.conf is the same
  as the one it is running.  If not an error message is displayed.  To
  silence this message add NO_CONF_HASH to DebugFlags in your slurm.conf.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see "man slurm.conf" for details)
=============================================================
* Added VSizeFactor to enforce virtual memory limits for jobs and job steps as
  a percentage of their real memory allocation.

* Added new option for SelectTypeParameters of CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE. This
  option will allocate one task per core by default. Without this option,
  by default one task will be allocated per thread on nodes with more than
  one ThreadsPerCore configured (i.e. no change in behavior without this
  option).

* Add new configuration parameters GroupUpdateForce and GroupUpdateTime. These 
  control when slurmctld updates its information of which users are in the
  groups allowed to use partitions. NOTE: There is no change in the default
  behavior.

* Added new configuration parameters SlurmSchedLogFile and SlurmSchedLogLevel
  to support writing scheduling events to a separate log file.

* Added "--enable-partial-attach" option to configure (build) script.

* Added support for new partition states of DRAIN and INACTIVE and new partition
  option of "Alternate" (alternate partition to use for jobs submitted to
  partitions that are currently in a state of DRAIN or INACTIVE).

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
* sinfo -R now has the user and timestamp in separate fields from the reason.

* Job submission commands (salloc, sbatch and srun) have a new option,
  --time-min, that permits the job's time limit to be reduced to the extent
  required to start early through backfill scheduling with the minimum value
  as specified.

* scontrol now has the ability to change a job step's time limit.

* scontrol now has the ability to shrink a job's size. Use a command of
  "scontrol update JobId=# NumNodes=#" or
  "scontrol update JobId=# NodeList=<names>". Subsequent job steps must
  explicitly specify an appropriate node count to work properly.

* Add support for slurmctld and slurmd option of "-n <value>" to reset the
  daemon's nice value.

BLUEGENE SPECIFIC CHANGES
=========================

OTHER CHANGES
=============
* Much functionality has been added to account_storage/pgsql.  The plugin
   is still in a very beta state.

* SLURM's PMI library (for MPICH2) has been modified to properly execute an
  executable program stand-alone (single MPI task launched without srun).

* Added support for spank_get_item() to get S_STEP_ALLOC_CORES and
  S_STEP_ALLOC_MEM. Support will remain for S_JOB_ALLOC_CORES and
  S_JOB_ALLOC_MEM.

* Changed error mesage from "Requested time limit exceeds partition limit"
  "Requested time limit is invalid (exceeds some limit)". The error can be
  triggered by a time limit exceeding the user/bank limit or the time-min
  exceeding the job or partition's time limit.

* Added support for debugger partial task attach if the option
  "--enable-partial-attach" is passed to the configure (build) script.
