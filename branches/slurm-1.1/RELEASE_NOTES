RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 1.1
15 May 2006
See the file NEWS for more details.

* Added support for file broadcast to allocated compute nodes (see 
  "man sbcast")
* Added support for different executable files and arguments by task, based
  upon a configuration file (see "man srun" option "--multi-prog")
* Added support for hierarchical communications. Added new configuration 
  option "TreeWidth" (see "man slurm.conf")
* Major re-write of accounting logic, some sacct format changes (see 
  "man sacct")
* Slurm.conf option "JobAcctType=jobacct/log" is no longer supported, 
  use "JobAcctType=jobacct/none", "JobAcctType=jobacct/linux" or 
  "JobAcctType=jobacct/aix" (see "man slurm.conf")
* Support large (over 2 GB) files on 32-bit Linux systems
* Change in support for test suite: 'testsuite/expect/globals.example'
  is now 'testsuite/expect/globals' and you can override variable
  settings with a new file 'testsuite/expect/globals.local'
* Job suspend now sends SIGTSTP, sleep(1), sends SIGSTOP for better
  MPI support
* Change time format in job completion logging (JobCompType=jobcomp/filetxt)
  from "MM/DD HH:MM:SS" to "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS", conforming with the ISO8601
  standard format
* Add support for ISO8601 time format for all SLURM commands by defining
  "CFLAGS=-DISO8601" before configuration. NOTE: This may break Moab, 
  Maui, and/or LSF schedulers.
* Sacct can get accounting information about currently running jobs and 
  job steps (see "man sacct")
* Added support for mapping "%h" in configured SlurmdLog to the hostname
  (see "man slurm.conf")
* Add PropagatePrioProcess to control propagation of a user's nice value
  to spawned tasks (see "man slurm.conf")
* Add support for srun to set PMI communications address (see "man srun" 
  option "--ctrl-comm-ifhn")
* Re-wrote slurm.conf parsing logic. A "NodeName" may now occur only once 
  in a slurm.conf file.  If you want to make nodes DOWN in slurm.conf, use 
  the new "DownNodes" keyword (see "man slurm.conf")
* Added support for XCPU task launch mechanism
* Gracefully handle request to submit batch job from within an existing
  batch job
* Warn user attempting to create a job allocation from within an existing 
  job allocation
* Add new function to get a job's time limit (see "man slurm_get_rem_time")
* "JobAcctType=jobacct/log"
* Slurm.conf parameter "InactiveLimit" is not enforced for RootOnly partitions
  (see "man slurm.conf")
* Added support for memory affinity (see "man srun" option "--mem_bind")
* Configuration parameter "HeartBeatInterval" is deprecated. Now uses half
  of "SlurmdTimeout" and "SlurmctldTimeout" for communications to slurmd and
  slurmctld daemons respectively (see "man slurm.conf")
* Support node-specific resource limits controlled via Pluggable Authentication 
  Mechanism (PAM, see "man slurm.conf" parameter "UsePAM")
* Support stackable plugins to be called before and/or after execution of 
  each task spawned as part of a user's job step (see "man slurm.conf" 
  parameter "PlugStackConfig")
* Slurm.conf paramter "JobAcctLoc" has been changed to "JobAcctLogFile"

BLUEGENE SPECIFIC UPDATES
* Resource allocations based upon c-node counts rather than base partition 
  counts, all commands and configuration parameters effected
* Added support for overlapping blocks (see "man bluegene.conf")
* Added support for dynamic block creation (see "man bluegene.conf")
* Added support for srun -w option
* Before assigning a job to a block the plugin will check the base
  partitions to make sure they aren't in error state
