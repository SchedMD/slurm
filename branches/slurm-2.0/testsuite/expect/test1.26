# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Submit job directly to slurmd without use of slurmctld scheduler.
#          (--no-allocate option). NOTE: Needs to run as SlurmUser or root.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "WARNING: ..." with an explanation of why the test can't be made, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
