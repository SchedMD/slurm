    completing until the container destroy succeeds.

* Changes in SLURM 0.6.0-pre7
=============================
 -- Disable localtime_r() calls from forked processes (semaphore set 
    in another pthread can deadlock calls to localtime_r made from

    an argument.
 -- Modify smap so it shows all nodes and partitions by default (even 
    nodes that the user can't access, otherwise there are holes in

    request RPC.
 -- Fix mpich-gm bugs, thanks to Takao Hatazaki (HP).
 -- Fix code for clean build with gcc 2.96, Takao Hatazaki (HP).
 -- Add node update state of "RESUME" to return DRAINED, DRAINING, or 
    DOWN node to service (IDLE or ALLOCATED state).
 -- smap keeps trying to connect to slurmctld in iterative mode rather 
    than just aborting on failure.
 -- Add squeue option --node to filter by node name.
 -- Modify squeue --user option to accept not only user names, but also
    user IDs.

    user/group (allows root to run jobs and allocate nodes for other users 
    in a RootOnly partition).
 -- Fix node processing if state change requested via scontrol prior to 
    initial node registration.
 
* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0
========================
 -- Support for AIX added (a few bugs do remain).
 -- Fix memory leak in slurmctld, slurm_cred_create().
 -- On ELF systems, export BNR_* functions from SLURM API.

    nodes, jobs, and job steps as well). APIs and commands 
    modified to optionally display hidden partitions.
 -- Modify partition's group_allow test to be based upon the user 
    of the allocation rather than the user making the allocation 
    request (user root for LCRM batch jobs).

 -- Fix bug in slurmctld's building of nodelist for job (failed if 
    more than one numeric field in node name).
 -- Change "scontrol completing" and "sinfo" to use job's node bitmap
    to identify nodes associated with that particular job that are 
    still processing job completion. This will work properly for 
    shared nodes.
 -- Set SLURM_DISTRIBUTION environment varible for user tasks.
 -- Fix for file descriptor leak in slurmd.
 -- Propagate stacksize limit to jobs along with other resource limits
    that were previously ignored.

    nodes along with their REASON field.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre8
===============================
 -- Queue outgoing message traffic rather than immediately spawning 
    pthreads (under heavy load this resulted in hundreds of pthreads

 -- Sinfo sort partitions in slurm.conf order, new sort option ("#P").
 -- Document how to gracefully change plugin values.
 -- Slurmctld does not attempt to recover jobs when the switch plugin
    value changes (decision reached when any job's switch state recovery
    fails).
 -- Node does not transition from COMPLETING to DOWN state due to
    not responding. Wait for tasks to complete or admin to set DOWN.
 -- Always chmod SlurmdSpoolDir to 755 (a umask of 007 was resulting 
    in batch jobs failing).
 -- Return errors when trying to change configuration parameters
    AuthType, SchedulerType, and SwitchType via "scontrol reconfig"
    or SIGHUP. Document how to safely change these parameters.
 -- Plugin-specific error number definitions and descriptive strings 
    moved from common into plugin modules.

    systems (QsNet and QsNetII).
 -- Added some missing read locks for references for slurmctld's 
    configuration data structure

   - slurm/312: Freeing non-allocated memory and killing slurmd
 -- Assorted changes to support RedHat Enterprise Linux 3.0 and IA64
 -- Initial Elan4 and libelanctrl support (--with-elan).

    rather than previously saved state. Additional improvements to 
    avoid inconsistent job/node/partition states at restart. Job state 
    information is used to arbitrate conflicts.
 -- Orphaned file descriptors eliminated.

* Changes in SLURM 0.2.16
=========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/265: Early termination of srun could cause job to remain in queue.
