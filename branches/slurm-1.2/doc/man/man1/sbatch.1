sbatch \- Submit a batch script to SLURM.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
sbatch [\fIoptions\fP] \fIscript\fP [\fIargs\fP...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
sbatch submits a batch script to SLURM.  The batch script may be given to
sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified,
sbatch will read in a script from standard input. The batch script may contain
options preceeded with "#SBATCH" before any executable commands in the script.

sbatch exits immediately after the script is successfully transferred to the
SLURM controller and assigned a SLURM job ID.  The batch script is not
necessarily granted resources immediately, it may sit in the queue of pending
jobs for some time before its required resources become available.

When the job allocation is finally granted for the batch script, SLURM
runs a single copy of the batch script on the first node in the set of
allocated nodes.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 

.TP
\fB\-\-begin\fR[=]<\fItime\fR>
Submit the batch script to the SLURM controller immediately, like normal, but
tell the controller to defer the allocation of the job until the specified time.

Time may be of the form \fIHH:MM:SS\fR to run a job at 
a specific time of day (seconds are optional).
(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) 
You may also specify \fImidnight\fR, \fInoon\fR, or 
\fIteatime\fR (4pm) and you can have a time\-of\-day suffixed 
with \fIAM\fR or \fIPM\fR for running in the morning or the evening.  
You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving 
a date in the form \fImonth\-name\fR day with an optional year,
or giving a date of the form \fIMMDDYY\fR or \fIMM/DD/YY\fR 
or \fIDD.MM.YY\fR. You can also 
give times like \fInow + count time\-units\fR, where the time\-units
can be \fIminutes\fR, \fIhours\fR, \fIdays\fR, or \fIweeks\fR 
and you can tell SLURM to run the job today with the keyword
\fItoday\fR and to run the job tomorrow with the keyword
\fItomorrow\fR.
The value may be changed after job submission using the
\fBscontrol\fR command.

.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint\fR[=]<\fIlist\fR>
Specify a list of constraints. 
The constraints are features that have been assigned to the nodes by 
the slurm administrator. 
The \fIlist\fR of constraints may include multiple features separated 
by ampersand (AND) and/or vertical bar (OR) operators.
For example: \fB\-\-constraint="opteron&video"\fR or 
\fB\-\-constraint="fast|faster"\fR.
If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated 
nodes, then use the OR operator and enclose the options within square brackets. 
For example: "\fB\-\-constraint="[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]"\fR might 
be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a single rack of 
the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.
If no nodes have the requested features, then the job will be rejected 
by the slurm job manager.

.TP 
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR[=]<\fIncpus\fR>
Advise the SLURM controller that ensuing job steps will require \fIncpus\fR 
number of processors per task.  Without this option, the controller will
just try to allocate one processor per task.

For instance,
consider an application that has 4 tasks, each requiring 3 processors.  If our
cluster is comprised of quad\-processors nodes and we simply ask for
12 processors, the controller might give us only 3 nodes.  However, by using
the \-\-cpus\-per\-task=3 options, the controller knows that each task requires
3 processors on the same node, and the controller will grant an allocation
of 4 nodes, one for each of the 4 tasks.

.TP
\fB\-\-comment\fR
An arbitrary comment.

.TP
\fB\-\-contiguous\fR
Demand a contiguous range of nodes. The default is "yes". Specify
\-\-contiguous=no if a contiguous range of nodes is not required.

.TP 
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-workdir\fR[=]<\fIdirectory\fR>
Set the working directory of the batch script to \fIdirectory\fR before
it it executed.

.TP 
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependency\fR[=]<\fIjobid\fR>
Defer the start of this job until the specified \fIjobid\fR has completed.
Many jobs can share the same dependency and these jobs may even belong to
different  users.   The  value may be changed after job submission using the
scontrol command.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-error\fR[=]<\fIfilename pattern\fR>
Instruct SLURM to connect the batch script's standard error directly to the 
file name specified in the "\fIfilename pattern\fR".
See the \fB\-\-input\fR option for filename specification options.

.TP
\fB\-\-exclusive\fR
The job allocation cannot share nodes with other running jobs.  This is
the oposite of \-\-shared, whichever option is seen last on the command line
will win.  (The default shared/exclusive behaviour depends on system
configuration.)

.TP 
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-nodefile\fR[=]<\fInode file\fR>
Much like \-\-nodelist, but the list is contained in a file of name
\fInode file\fR.  The node names of the list may also span multiple lines
in the file.    Duplicate node names in the file will be ignored.
The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names
will be sorted my SLURM.

.TP
\fB\-\-get\-user\-env\fR[=\fItimeout\fR]
This option will tell sbatch to retrieve the
login environment variables for the user specified in the \-\-uid option.
The environment variables are retrieved by running "su - <username> -c
/usr/bin/env" and parsing the output.  Be aware that any environment
variables already set in sbatch's environment will take precedence over any
environment variables in the user's login environment.
Optional timeout value is in seconds. Default value is 8 seconds.
NOTE: This option only works if the caller has an effective uid of "root".
This option was originally created for use by Moab.

.TP
\fB\-\-gid\fR[=]<\fIgroup\fR>
If \fBsbatch\fR is run as root, and the \fB\-\-gid\fR option is used, 
submit the job with \fIgroup\fR's group access permissions.  \fIgroup\fR 
may be the group name or the numerical group ID.

.TP 
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help information and exit.

.TP 
\fB\-I\fR,\fB\-\-immediate\fR
The batch script will only be submitted to the controller if the resources
necessary to grant its job allocation are immediately available.  If the
job allocation will have to wait in a queue of pending jobs, the batch script
will not be submitted.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR[=]<\fIfilename pattern\fR>
Instruct SLURM to connect the batch script's standard input
directly to the file name specified in the "\fIfilename pattern\fR".

By default, "/dev/null" is open on the batch script's standard input and both
standard output and standard error are directed to a file of the name
"slurm\-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced with the job allocation number, as
described below.

The filename pattern may contain one or more replacement symbols, which are
a percent sign "%" followed by a letter (e.g. %t).

Supported replacement symbols are:
.PD 0
.RS 10
.TP 
\fB%j\fR
Job allocation number.
.PD 0
.TP 
\fB%N\fR
Node name. (Will result in a separate file per node.)
.RE

.TP
\fB\-J\fR, \fB\-\-job\-name\fR[=]<\fIjobname\fR>
Specify a name for the job allocation. The specified name will appear along with
the job id number when querying running jobs on the system. The default
is the name of the batch script, or just "sbatch" if the script is
read on sbatch's standard input.

.TP
\fB\-\-jobid\fR=<\fIjobid\fR>
Allocate resources as the specified job id.
NOTE: Only valid for user root.

.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-no\-kill\fR
Do not automatically terminate a job of one of the nodes it has been 
allocated fails.  The user will assume the responsibilities for fault\-tolerance
should a node fail.  When there is a node failure, any active job steps (usually
MPI jobs) on that node will almost certainly suffer a fatal error, but with
\-\-no\-kill, the job allocation will not be revoked so the user may launch
new job steps on the remaining nodes in their allocation.

By default SLURM terminates the entire job allocation if any node fails in its
range of allocated nodes.

.TP
\fB\-\-mail\-type\fR=\fItype\fR
Notify user by email when certain event types occur. 
Valid \fItype\fR values are BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL (any state change). 
The user to be notified is indicated with \fB\-\-mail\-user\fR. 

.TP
\fB\-\-mail\-user\fR=\fIuser\fR
User to receive email notification of state changes as defined by 
\fB\-\-mail\-type\fR.
The default value is the username of the submitting user.

.TP
\fB\-\-mem\fR[=]<\fIMB\fR>
Specify a minimum amount of real memory.

.TP
\fB\-\-mincores\fR[=]<\fIn\fR>
Specify a minimum number of cores per socket.

.TP
\fB\-\-mincpus\fR[=]<\fIn\fR>
Specify minimum number of cpus per node.

.TP
\fB\-\-minsockets\fR[=]<\fIn\fR>
Specify a minimum number of sockets (physical processors) per node.

.TP
\fB\-\-minthreads\fR[=]<\fIn\fR>
Specify a minimum number of threads per core.

.TP 
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-nodes\fR[=]<\fInumber|[min]\-[max]\fR>
Specify the number of nodes to be used by this job step.  This option accepts
either a single number, or a range of possible node counts.  If a single number
is used, such as "\-N 4", then the allocation is asking for four and ONLY four
nodes.  If a range is specified, such as "\-N 2\-6", SLURM controller may
grant the batch job anywhere from 2 to 6 nodes.  When using a range, either of
the min or max options may be omitted.  For instance, "\-N 10\-" means
"no fewer than 10 nodes", and "\-N \-20" means "no more than 20 nodes".  The
default value of this option is one node, but other command line options
may implicitly set the default node count to a higher value.
The job will be allocated as many nodes as possible within the range specified 
and without delaying the initiation of the job.
The partition's node limits supersede those of the job. 
If a job's node limits are outside of the range permitted for its 
associated partition, the job will be left in a PENDING state. 
This permits possible execution at a later time, when the partition 
limit is changed.
If a job node limit exceeds the number of nodes configured in the 
partition, the job will be rejected.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-tasks\fR[=]<\fInumber\fR>
sbatch does not launch tasks, it requests an allocation of resources and submits
a batch script.  However this \-\-tasks option advizes the SLURM controller
that job steps run within this allocation will launch a maximum of \fInumber\fR
tasks.  This option, possibly with collaboration with the \-\-cpus\-per\-task
option, will directly impact the number of processors granted to the job
allocation.

.TP 
\fB\-\-nice\fR[=]<\fIadjustment\fR>
Run the job with an adjusted scheduling priority within SLURM.
With no adjustment value the scheduling priority is decreased
by 100. The adjustment range is from \-10000 (highest priority)
to 10000 (lowest priority). Only privileged users can specify
a negative adjustment. NOTE: This option is presently
ignored if \fISchedulerType=sched/wiki\fR or 
\fISchedulerType=sched/wiki2\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-requeue\fR
Specifies that the batch job should not be requeued.
Setting this option will prevent system administrators from being able 
to restart the job (for example, after a scheduled downtime).
When a job is requeued, the batch script is initiated from its beginning.

.TP
\fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-node\fR[=]<\fIn\fR>
Specify the number of tasks to be launched per node.
Equivalent to \fB\-\-tasks\-per\-node\fR.

.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-overcommit\fR
Overcommit resources. Normally, \fBsbatch\fR will allocate one cpu per
task to be executed. By specifying \fB\-\-overcommit\fR you are explicitly
allowing more than one process per cpu. However no more than
\fBMAX_TASKS_PER_NODE\fR tasks are permitted to execute per node.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR[=]<\fIfilename pattern\fR>
Instruct SLURM to connect the batch script's standard output directly to the 
file name specified in the "\fIfilename pattern\fR".
See the \fB\-\-input\fR option for filename specification options.

.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partition\fR[=]<\fIpartition name\fR>
Request a specific partition for the resource allocation.  If not specified, the
default behaviour is to allow the slurm controller to select the default
partition as designated by the system administrator.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress informational messages from sbatch. Errors will still be displayed.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-share\fR
The job allocation can share nodes with other running jobs.  (The default
shared/exclusive behaviour depends on system configuration.)
This may result the allocation being granted sooner than if the \-\-shared
option was not set and allow higher system utilization, but application
performance will likely suffer due to competition for resources within a node.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR=\fItime\fR
Set a  limit on the total run time of the job allocation.
If the requested time limit exceeds the partition's time limit, the 
job will be left in a PENDING state (possibly indefinitely).  The default
time limit is the partition's time limit.  When the time limit is reached,
the each task in each job step is sent SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL. The
interval between signals is specified by the SLURM configuration parameter
\fBKillWait\fR.  A time limit of zero represents unlimited time.
Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", 
"hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and 
"days\-hours:minutes:seconds".

.TP
\fB\-\-tasks\-per\-node\fR[=]<\fIn\fR>
Specify the number of tasks to be launched per node.
Equivalent to \fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-node\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-tmp\fR[=]<\fIMB\fR>
Specify a minimum amount of temporary disk space.

.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-account\fR[=]<\fIaccount\fR>
Change resource use by this job to specified account.
The \fIaccount\fR is an arbitrary string. The account name may 
be changed after job submission using the \fBscontrol\fR 
command.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-usage\fR
Display brief usage message and exit.

.TP
\fB\-\-uid\fR[=]<\fIuser\fR>
Attempt to submit and/or run a job as \fIuser\fR instead of the
invoking user id. The invoking user's credentials will be used
to check access permissions for the target partition. User root
may use this option to run jobs as a normal user in a RootOnly
partition for example. If run as root, \fBsbatch\fR will drop
its permissions to the uid specified after node allocation is
successful. \fIuser\fR may be the user name or numerical user ID.

.TP 
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information and exit.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase the verbosity of sbatch's informational messages.  Multiple \-v's
will further increase sbatch's verbosity.

.TP 
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-nodelist\fR[=]<\fInode name list\fR>
Request a specific list of node names.  The list may be specified as a
comma\-separated list of node names, or a range of node names
(e.g. mynode[1\-5,7,...]).  Duplicate node names in the list will be ignored.
The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names
will be sorted my SLURM.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR[=]<\fInode name list\fR>
Explicitly exclude certain nodes from the resources granted to the job.

.PP
The following options support Blue Gene systems, but may be 
applicable to other systems as well.

.TP
\fB\-\-blrts\-image\fR[=]<\fIpath\fR>
Path to blrts image for bluegene block.
Default from \fIblugene.conf\fR if not set.

.TP
\fB\-\-conn\-type\fR[=]<\fItype\fR>
Require the partition connection type to be of a certain type.  
On Blue Gene the acceptable of \fItype\fR are MESH, TORUS and NAV.  
If NAV, or if not set, then SLURM will try to fit a TORUS else MESH.
You should not normally set this option.
SLURM will normally allocate a TORUS if possible for a given geometry.

.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-geometry\fR[=]<\fIXxYxZ\fR>
Specify the geometry requirements for the job. The three numbers 
represent the required geometry giving dimensions in the X, Y and 
Z directions. For example "\-\-geometry=2x3x4", specifies a block 
of nodes having 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 nodes (actually base partions on 
Blue Gene).

.TP
\fB\-\-linux\-image\fR[=]<\fIpath\fR>
Path to linux image for bluegene block.
Default from \fIblugene.conf\fR if not set.

.TP
\fB\-\-mloader\-image\fR[=]<\fIpath\fR>
Path to mloader image for bluegene block.
Default from \fIblugene.conf\fR if not set.

.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-no\-rotate\fR
Disables rotation of the job's requested geometry in order to fit an 
appropriate partition.
By default the specified geometry can rotate in three dimensions.

.TP
\fB\-\-ramdisk\-image\fR[=]<\fIpath\fR>
Path to ramdisk image for bluegene block.
Default from \fIblugene.conf\fR if not set.

.TP
\fB\-\-reboot\fR
Force the allocated nodes to reboot before starting the job.

.TP
\fB\-\-wrap\fR[=]<\fIcommand string\fR>
Sbatch will wrap the specified command string in a simple "sh" shell script,
and submit that script to the slurm controller.  When --wrap is used,
a script name and arguments may not be specified on the command line; instead
the sbatch-generated wrapper script is used.

.SH "INPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Upon startup, sbatch will read and handle the options set in the following
environment variables.  Note that environment variables will override any
options set in a batch script, and command line options will override any
environment variables.

.SH "OUTPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The SLURM controller will set the following variables in the environment of
the batch script.

.TP
\fBSLURM_JOB_ID\fR (and \fBSLURM_JOBID\fR for backwards compatibility)
The ID of the job allocation.
.TP
\fBSLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE\fR
Count of processors available to the job on this node.
Note the select/linear plugin allocates entire nodes to
jobs, so the value indicates the total count of CPUs on the node.
The select/cons_res plugin allocates individual processors
to jobs, so this number indicates the number of processors
on this node allocated to the job.
.TP
\fBSLURM_JOB_NODELIST\fR (and \fBSLURM_NODELIST\fR for backwards compatibility)
List of nodes allocated to the job.
.TP
\fBSLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES\fR (and \fBSLURM_NNODES\fR for backwards compatibility)
Total number of nodes in the job's resource allocation.
.TP
\fBSLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE\fR
Number of tasks to be initiated on each node. Values are
comma separated and in the same order as SLURM_NODELIST.
If two or more consecutive nodes are to have the same task
count, that count is followed by "(x#)" where "#" is the
repetition count. For example, "SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE=2(x3),1"
indicates that the first three nodes will each execute three
tasks and the fourth node will execute one task.
.TP
\fBMPIRUN_NOALLOCATE\fR
Do not allocate a block on Blue Gene systems only.
.TP
\fBMPIRUN_NOFREE\fR
Do not free a block on Blue Gene systems only.
.TP
\fBMPIRUN_PARTITION\fR
The block name on Blue Gene systems only.
