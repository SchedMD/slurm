\f2\fP\f2options \fP 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with SLURM are logged in the job 
accounting log file.
.PP
The 
.BR "sacct "
command displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log 
file in a variety of forms for your analysis.
The 
.BR "sacct "
command displays information on jobs, job steps, status, and exitcodes by 
default.
You can tailor the output with the use of the 
\f3\-\-fields=\fP 
option to specify the fields to be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the 
.BR "sacct "
command displays job accounting data for all users, although there are 
options to filter the output to report only the jobs from a specified 
user or group.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the 
.BR "sacct "
command limits the display of job accounting data to jobs that were 
launched with their own user identifier (UID) by default.
Data for other users can be displayed with the 
\f3\-\-all\fP,
\f3\-\-user\fP,
or 
\f3\-\-uid\fP 
options.
.TP "10"
\f3Note: \fP\c
Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your systems
\f2getrusage(3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.
.IP
If --dump is specified, the field selection options (--brief,
--fields, ...) have no effect. 
.IP
Elapsed time fields are presented as 2 fields, integral seconds and integral microseconds
.IP
If --dump is not specified, elapsed time fields are presented as
[[days-]hours:]minutes:seconds.hundredths.

The default input file is the file named in the jobacct_logfile
parameter in slurm.conf.

Space characters are not allowed in the \f2cluster_list\fP. \-1 for

Dumps the raw data records.
.IP 

The section titled "INTERPRETING THE \-\-dump OPTION OUTPUT" describes the 
data output when this option is used.

.TP 
\f3\-\-duplicates\fP
If SLURM job ids are reset, but the job accounting log file isn't
reset at the same time (with -e, for example), some job numbers will
probably appear more than once in the accounting log file to refer to
different jobs; such jobs can be distinguished by the "submit" time
stamp in the data records.
.IP 
When data for specific jobs are requested with the --jobs option, we
assume that the user wants to see only the most recent job with that
number. This behavior can be overridden by specifying --duplicates, in
which case all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.
.IP
When --jobs is not specified, we report data for all jobs that match
the selection criteria, even if some of the job numbers are
reused. Specify that you only want the most recent job for each
selected job number with the --noduplicates option.

The output for the
