LLNL-SPECIFIC RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.0
19 February 2009

For processor-scheduled clusters (*not* allocating whole nodes to jobs):
Set "DefMemPerCPU" and "MaxMemPerCPU" as appropriate to restrict memory 
available to a job. Also set "JobAcctGatherType=jobacct_gather/linux"
for enforcement (periodic sampling of memory use by the job).  You can change 
said sampling rate from the default (every 30 seconds) by setting the 
"JobAcctGatherFrequency" option to a different number of seconds in 
the slurm.conf.

For InfiniBand switch systems, add switch topology information to 
slurm.conf. Options used are TopologyPlugin, SwitchName, Switches, 
and Nodes. The SwitchName is any convenient name for bookkeeping 
purposes only. For example:
# Switch Topology Information
TopologyPlugin=topology/slurm.conf
SwitchName=s0 Nodes=tux[0-11]
SwitchName=s1 Nodes=tux[12-23]
SwitchName=s2 Nodes=tux[24-35]
SwitchName=s3 Switches=s[0-2]

Remove the "preserve-env.so" SPANK plugin. The functionality is now
directly in SLURM.

SLURM version 2.0 must use a database daemon (slurmdbd) at version 2.0
or higher. While we are testing version 2.0, set "AccountingStoragePort=????".
Once we upgrade the production slurmdbd to version 2.0, this change will
not be required.  You can likewise test 1.3.7+ clusters with the same port 
since 2.0 slurmdbd will talk to 1.3.7+ SLURM.

SLURM state files in version 2.0 are different from those of version 1.3.
After installing SLURM version 2.0, plan to restart without preserving 
jobs or other state information. While SLURM version 1.3 is still running, 
cancel all pending and running jobs (e.g.
"scancel --state=pending; scancel --state=running"). Then stop and restart 
daemons with the "-c" option or use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".
