<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This document describes the unique features of SLURM on the
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/bluegene">IBM Blue Gene</a> systems. 
You should be familiar with the SLURM's mode of operation on Linux clusters 
before studying the relatively few differences in Blue Gene operation 
described in this document.</p>

<p>Blue Gene systems have several unique features making for a few 
differences in how SLURM operates there. 
The basic unit of resource allocation is a <i>base partition</i> or <i>midplane</i>.
The <i>base partitions</i> are connected in a three-dimensional torus. 
Each <i>base partition</i> includes 512 <i>c-nodes</i> each containing two processors; 
one designed primarily for computations and the other primarily for managing communications. 
SLURM considers each <i>base partition</i> as one node with 1024 processors. 
The <i>c-nodes</i> can execute only one process and thus are unable to execute both 
the user's jobs and SLURM's <i>slurmd</i> daemon.
Thus the <i>slurmd</i> daemon executes on one of the Blue Gene <i>Front End Nodes</i>. 
This <i>slurmd</i> daemon provides (almost) all of the normal SLURM services 
for every <i>base partition</i> on the system. </p>

<h3>User Tools</h3>

<p>The normal set of SLURM user tools: srun, scancel, sinfo, squeue and scontrol 
provide all of the expected services except support for job steps. 
SLURM performs resource allocation for the job, but initiation of tasks is performed 
using the <i>mpirun</i> command. SLURM has no concept of a job step on Blue Gene.
Four new srun options are available: 
<i>--geometry</i> (specify job size in each dimension),
<i>--no-rotate</i> (disable rotation of geometry), 
<i>--conn-type</i> (specify interconnect type between base partitions, mesh or torus), and 
You can also continue to use the <i>--nodes</i> option with a minimum and (optionally) 
maximum node count. The <i>--ntasks</i> option continues to be supported. 
See the srun man pages for details. </p>

<p>To reiterate: srun is used to submit a job script, but mpirun is used to launch the parallel tasks. 
<b>It is highly recommended that the srun <i>--batch</i> option be used to submit a script.</b> 
Note that a SLURM batch job's default stdout and stderr file names are generated 
using the SLURM job ID. 
When the SLURM control daemon is restarted, SLURM job ID values can be repeated, 
therefore it is recommended that batch jobs explicitly specify unique names for 
stdout and stderr files using the srun options <i>--output</i> and <i>--error</i>
respectively.
While the srun <i>--allocate</i> option may be used to create an interactive SLURM job, 
it will be the responsibility of the user to insure that the <i>bglblock</i> 
is ready for use before initiating any mpirun commands. 
SLURM will assume this responsibility for batch jobs. 
The script that you submit to SLURM can contain multiple invocations of mpirun as
well as any desired commands for pre- and post-processing.
The mpirun command will get its <i>bglblock</i> or BGL partition information from the
<i>MPIRUN_PARTITION</i> as set by SLURM. A sample script is shown below.
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# pre-processing
date
# processing
mpirun -exec /home/user/prog -cwd /home/user -args 123
mpirun -exec /home/user/prog -cwd /home/user -args 124
# post-processing
date 
</pre></p>
 
<a name="naming">
<p>The naming of nodes includes a three-digit suffix representing the base partition's 
location in the X, Y and Z dimensions with a zero origin.
For example, "bgl012" represents the base partition whose location is at X=0, Y=1 and Z=2. 
Since jobs must be allocated consecutive nodes in all three dimensions, we have developed 
an abbreviated format for describing the nodes in one of these three-dimensional blocks. 
The node's prefix of "bgl" is followed by the end-points of the block enclosed in square-brackets. 
For example, " bgl[620x731]" is used to represent the eight nodes enclosed in a block 
with endpoints bgl620 and bgl731 (bgl620, bgl621, bgl630, bgl631, bgl720, bgl721, 
bgl730 and bgl731).</p></a>

<p>One new tool provided is <i>smap</i>.
Smap is aware of system topography and provides a map of what nodes are allocated 
to jobs, partitions, etc. 
See the smap man page for details.
A sample of smap output is provided below showing the location of five jobs. 
Note the format of the list of nodes allocated to each job.
Also note that idle (unassigned) base partitions are indicated by a period.
Down and drained base partitions (those not available for use) are 
indicated by a number sign (bgl703 in the display below).
The legend is for illustrative purposes only. 
The origin (zero in every dimension) is shown at the rear left corner of the bottom plane.
Each set of four consecutive lines represents a plane in the Y dimension.
Values in the X dimension increase to the right.
Values in the Z dimension increase down and toward the left.</p>

</pre>

<p>Note that jobs enter the SLURM state RUNNING as soon as the have been 
allocated a bglblock. 
If the bglblock is in a READY state, the job will begin execution almost 
immediately. 
Otherwise the execution of the job will not actually begin until the 
bglblock is in a READY state, which can require booting the block and 
a delay of minutes to do so.
You can identify the bglblock associated with your job using the command
<i>smap -Dj -c</i> and the state of the bglblock with the command 
<i>smap -Db -c</i>.
The time to boot a bglblock is related to its size, but should range from 
from a few minutes to about 15 minutes for a bglblock containing 64 
base partitions. 
Only after the bglblock is READY will your job's output file be created 
and the script execution begin. 
If the bglblock boot fails, SLURM will attempt to reboot several times 
before draining the associated nodes and aborting the job.</p>

<p>The job will continue to be in a RUNNING state until the bgljob has 
completed and the bglblock ownership is changed. 
The time for completing a bgljob has freqently been on the order of 
five minutes.
In summary, your job may appear in SLURM as RUNNING for 15 minutes 
before the script actually begins to 5 minutes after it completes.
These delays are the result of BGL infrastructure issues and are 
not due to anything in SLURM.</p>

<p>When using smap in curses mode you can scroll through the different windows
using the arrow keys.  The <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> arrow keys scroll 
the window containing the grid, and the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> arrow 
keys scroll the window containing the text information.</p>

<h3>System Administration</h3>

<p><b>If running on a multi X-dim system external wiring may be different 
that programmed into slurm.  If you have more than 2 nodes in the X-dim please 
have a wiring diagram of your system and query slurm-dev@lists.llnl.gov 
for advice.
</b></p>  

<p>Building a Blue Gene compatible system is dependent upon the <i>configure</i>
program locating some expected files. 
In particular, the configure script searches for <i>libdb2.so</i> in the 
directories <i>/home/bgdb2cli/sqllib</i> and <i>/u/bgdb2cli/sqllib</i>.
If your DB2 library file is in a different location, use the configure 
option <i>--with-db2-dir=PATH</i> to specify the parent directory.
If you have the same version of the operating system on both the 
Service Node (SN) and the Front End Nodes (FEN) then you can configure 
and build one set of files on the SN and install them on both the SN and FEN.
Note that if your FENs lack an installed <i>libdb2.so</i>, an smap 
built on the SN will be unable to execute at all on those nodes (it 
calls BGL Bridge APIs, that dynamically load <i>libdb2.so</i> completely 
out of our control).
You can handle this in two different ways. 
One option is to build two versions of smap (in the main SLURM RPM), 
one for the SN and the other for the FENs. 
The second option is to create a dummy <i>libdb2.so</i> on the FENs 
(it can just point to libslurm.so) so that smap can be initiated. 
Smap will discover if <i>libdb2.so</i> is invalid and avoid using 
any BGL Bridge function calls, which would fail. 
In either case, all smap functionality will be provided on the FEN 
except for the ability to map SLURM node names to and from 
row/rack/midplane data.</p> 

<p>If you have different versions of the operating system on the SN and FEN
(as was the case for some early system installations), then you will need 
to configure and build two sets of files for installation. 
One set will be for the Service Node (SN), which has direct access to the BGL Bridge APIs. 
The second set will be for the Front End Nodes (FEN), whick lack access to the 
Bridge APIs and interact with using Remote Proceedure Calls to the slurmctld daemon.
You should see "#define HAVE_BGL 1" and "#define HAVE_FRONT_END 1" in the "config.h" 
file for both the SN and FEN builds. 
You should also see "#define HAVE_BGL_FILES 1" in config.h on the SN before 
building SLURM. </p>

<p>The slurmctld daemon should execute on the system's service node.
If an optional backup daemon is used, it must be in some location where 
it is capable of executing BGL Bridge APIs.
One slurmd daemon should be configured to execute on one of the front end nodes. 
That one slurmd daemon represents communications channel for every base partition. 
A future release of SLURM will support multiple slurmd daemons on multiple
front end nodes.
You can use the scontrol command to drain individual nodes as desired and 
return them to service. </p>

<p>The slurm.conf (configuration) file needs to have the value of <i>InactiveLimit</i>
set to zero or not specified (it defaults to a value of zero). 
This is because there are no job steps and we don't want to purge jobs prematurely.
The value of <i>SelectType</i> must be set to "select/bluegene" in order to have 
node selection performed using a system aware of the system's topography 
and interfaces. 
The value of <i>SchedulerType</i> should be set to "sched/builtin".
The value of <i>Prolog</i> should be set to the full pathname of a program that 
will delay execution until the bglblock identified by the MPIRUN_PARTITION 
environment variable is ready for use. It is recommended that you construct a script 
that serves this function and calls the supplied program <i>sbin/slurm_prolog</i>.
The value of <i>Epilog</i> should be set to the full pathname of a program that 
will wait until the bglblock identified by the MPIRUN_PARTITION environment
variable is no longer usable by this job. It is recommended that you construct a script
that serves this function and calls the supplied program <i>sbin/slurm_epilog</i>.
The prolog and epilog programs are used to insure proper synchronization 
between the slurmctld daemon, the user job, and MMCS.
A multitude of other functions may also be placed into the prolog and 
epilog as desired (e.g. enabling/disabling user logins, puring file systmes, 
etc.).  Sample prolog and epilog scripts follow. </p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# Sample Blue Gene Prolog script
#
# Wait for bglblock to be ready for this job's use
/usr/sbin/slurm_prolog


#!/bin/bash
# Sample Blue Gene Epilog script
#
# Cancel job to start the termination process for this job
# and release the bglblock
/usr/bin/scancel $SLURM_JOBID
#
# Wait for bglblock to be released from this job's use
/usr/sbin/slurm_epilog
</pre>

<p>Since jobs with different geometries or other characteristics do not interfere 
with each other's scheduling, backfill scheduling is not presently meaningful.
SLURM's builtin scheduler on Blue Gene will sort pending jobs and then attempt 
to schedule all of them in priority order. 
This essentailly functions as if there is a separate queue for each job size.
Note that SLURM does support different partitions with an assortment of 
different scheduling parameters.
For example, SLURM can have defined a partition for full system jobs that 
is enabled to execute jobs only at certain times; while a default partition 
could be configured to execute jobs at other times. 
Jobs could still be queued in a partition that is configured in a DOWN 
state and scheduled to execute when changed to an UP state. 
Nodes can also be moved between slurm partitions either by changing 
the slurm.conf file and restarting the slurmctld daemon or by using 
the scontrol reconfig command. </p>

<p>SLURM node and partition descriptions should make use of the 
<a href="#naming">naming</a> conventions described above. For example,
"NodeName=bgl[000x733] NodeAddr=frontend0 NodeHostname=frontend0 Procs=1024". 
Note that the values of both NodeAddr and NodeHostname for all 
128 base partitions is the name of the front end node executing 
the slurmd daemon. 
The NodeName values represent base partitions. 
No computers are actually expected to return a value of "bgl000"
in response to the <i>hostname</i> command nor will any attempt 
be made to route message traffic to this address. </p>

<p>While users are unable to initiate SLURM job steps on Blue Gene systems, 
this restriction does not apply to user root or SlurmUser. 
Be advised that the one slurmd supporting all nodes is unable to manage a 
large number of job steps, so this ability should be used only to verify normal 
SLURM operation. 
If large numbers of job steps are initiated by slurmd, expect the daemon to 
fail due to lack of memory or other resources. 
It is best to minimize other work on the front end node executing slurmd
so as to maximize its performance and minimize other risk factors.</p>

<p>Presently the system administrator must explicitly define each of the 
Blue Gene partitions (or bglblocks) available to execute jobs. 
(<b>NOTE:</b> Blue Gene partitions are unrelated to SLURM partitions.)
Jobs must then execute in one of these pre-defined bglblocks. 
This is known as <i>static partitioning</i>. 
Each of these bglblocks are explicitly configured with either a mesh or 
torus interconnect.
They must also not overlap, except for the implicitly defined full-system 
bglblock.
In addition to the normal <i>slurm.conf</i> file, a new 
<i>bluegene.conf</i> configuration file is required with this information.
Put <i>bluegene.conf</i> into the SLURM configuration directory with
<i>slurm.conf</i>.
A sample file is installed in <i>bluegene.conf.example</i>. 
System administrators should use the <i>smap</i> tool to build appropriate 
configuration file for static partitioning. 
Note that <i>smap -Dc</i> can be run without the SLURM daemons 
active to establish the initial configuration.
Note that the defined bglblocks may not overlap (except for the 
full-system bglblock, which is implicitly created).
See the smap man page for more information.
You must insure that the nodes defined in <i>bluegene.conf</i> are 
consistent with those defined in <i>slurm.conf</i>.
Note that the Image and Numpsets values defined in <i>bluegene.conf</i>
are used only when SLURM creates bglblocks.
If previously defined bglblocks are used by SLURM, their configurations 
are not altered.
If you change the bglblock layout, then slurmctld and slurmd should 
both be cold-started (e.g. <b>/etc/init.d/slurm startclean</b>).
If you which to modify the Image and Numpsets values for existing
bglblocks, either modify them manually or destroy the bglblocks
and let SLURM recreate them. 
Note that in addition to the bglblocks defined in blugene.conf, an 
additional bglblock is created containing all resources defined 
all of the other defined bglblocks. 
If you modify the bglblocks, it is recommended that you restart 
both slurmctld and slurmd without preserving state 
(<i>/etc/init.d/slurm startclean</i>).
Note that SLURM wiring decisions are based upon the link-cards 
being interconnected in a specific fashion. 
If your BlueGene system is wired in an unconventional fashion, 
modifications to the file <i>src/partition_allocator/partition_allocator.c</i> 
may be required.
Make use of the SLURM partition mechanism to control access to these 
bglblocks. A sample <i>bluegene.conf</i> file is shown below.

<p>One more thing is required to support SLURM interactions with 
the DB2 database (at least as of the time this was written).
DB2 database access is required by the slurmctld daemon only.
All other SLURM daemons and commands interact with DB2 using 
remote procedure calls, which are processed by slurmctld.
DB2 access is dependent upon the environment variable
<b>BRIDGE_CONFIG_FILE</b>. 
Make sure this is set appropriate before initiating the 
slurmctld daemon. 
If desired, this environment variable and any other logic 
can be executed through the script <i>/etc/sysconfig/slurm</i>, 
which is automatically executed by <i>/etc/init.d/slurm</i> 
prior to initiating the SLURM daemons.</p>

<p>At some time in the future, we expect SLURM to support <i>dynamic 
partitioning</i> in which Blue Gene job partitions are created and destroyed 
as needed to accomodate the workload.
At that time the <i>bluegene.conf</i> configuration file will become obsolete.
Dynamic partition does involve substantial overhead including the 
rebooting of c-nodes and I/O nodes.</p>

<p>SLURM versions 0.4.23 and higher are designed to utilize Bluegene driver 
141(2005) or higher. This combination avoids rebooting bglblocks whenever
possible so as to minimize the system overhead for boots (which can be tens 
of minutes on large systems).
When slurmctld is initially started on an idle system, the bglblocks 
already defined in MMCS are read using the BGL Bridge APIs. 
If these bglblocks do not correspond to those defined in the bluegene.conf 
file, the old bglblocks with a prefix of "RMP" are destroyed and new ones 
created. 
When a job is scheduled, the appropriate bglblock is identified, 
its node use (virtual or coprocessor) set, its user set, and it is 
booted. 
Subsequent jobs use this same bglblock without rebooting by changing 
the associated user field.
The bglblock will be freed and then rebooted in order to change its 
node use (from virtual to coprocessor or vise-versa). 
Bglblocks will also be freed and rebooted when going to or from full-system 
jobs (two or more bglblocks sharing base partitions can not be in a 
ready state at the same time).
When this logic became available at LLNL, approximately 85 percent of 
bglblock boots were eliminated and the overhead of job startup went
from about 24% to about 6% of total job time.
Note that bglblocks will remain in a ready (booted) state when 
the SLURM daemons are stopped. 
This permits SLURM daemon restarts without loss of running jobs 
or rebooting of bglblocks.  </p>

<p>Be aware that SLURM will issue multiple bglblock boot requests as 
needed (e.g. when the boot fails). 
If the bglblock boot requests repeatedly fail, SLURM will configure 
the failing nodes to a DRAINED state so as to avoid continuing 
repeated reboots and the likely failure of user jobs. 
A system administrator should address the problem before returning 
the nodes to service.</p>

<p>If you cold-start slurmctld (<b>/etc/init.d/slurm startclean</b> 
or <b>slurmctld -c</b>) it is recommended that you also cold-start 
the slurmd at the same time. 
Failure to do so may result in errors being reported by both slurmd 
and slurmctld due to bglblocks that previously existed being deleted.</p>

<p>A new tool <b>sfree</b> has also been added to help admins free a BGL 
partition on request.  
<br>For usage use <b>sfree -u</b> and for help <b>-h</b>.</p>

<h4>Debugging</h4>

<p>All of the testing and debugging guidance provided in 
<a href="quickstart_admin.html"> Quick Start Administrator Guide</a>
apply to Blue Gene systems.
One can start the <b>slurmctld</b> and <b>slurmd</b> in the foreground 
with extensive debugging to establish basic functionality. 
Once runnning in production, the configured <b>SlurmctldLog</b> and 
<b>SlurmdLog</b> files will provide historical system information.
On Blue Gene systems, there is also a <b>BridgeAPILogFile</b> defined 
in <b>bluegene.conf</b> which can be configured to contain detailed 
information about every Bridge API call issued.</p>

<p>Note that slurmcltld log messages of the sort 
<i>Nodes bgl[000x133] not responding</i> are indicative of the slurmd 
daemon serving as a front-end to those nodes is not responding (on 
non-Blue Gene systems, the slurmd actaully does run on the compute 
nodes, so the message is more meaningful there). </p>
