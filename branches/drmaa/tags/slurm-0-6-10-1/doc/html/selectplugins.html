<h3> Overview</h3>
<p> This document describes SLURM node selection plugins and the API that defines 
them. It is intended as a resource to programmers wishing to write their own SLURM 
node selection plugins. This is version 0 of the API.</p>

<p>SLURM node selection plugins are SLURM plugins that implement the SLURM node selection
API described herein. They are intended to provide a mechanism for both selecting 
nodes for pending jobs and performing any system-specific tasks for job launch or 
termination. The plugins must conform to the SLURM Plugin API with the following 
specifications:</p>
<p><span class="commandline">const char plugin_type[]</span><br>
The major type must be &quot;select.&quot; The minor type can be any recognizable 
abbreviation for the type of node selection algorithm. We recommend, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>linear</b>&#151;A plugin that selects nodes assuming a one-dimensional 
array of nodes. The nodes are selected so as to minimize the number of consecutive 
sets of nodes utilizing a best-fit algorithm. While supporting shared nodes, 
this plugin does not allocate individual processors, memory, etc. 
This plugin is recommended for systems without shared nodes.</li>
<li><b>cons_res</b>&#151;A plugin that can allocate individual processors, 
memory, etc. within nodes. This plugin is recommended for systems with 
many non-parallel programs sharing nodes. For more information see
<a href=cons_res.html>Consumable Resources in SLURM</a>.</li>
<li><b>bluegene</b>&#151;<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/bluegene">IBM Blue Gene</a>  
node selector. Note that this plugin not only selects the nodes for a job, but performs 
some initialization and termination functions for the job.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="commandline">plugin_name</span> and 
<span class="commandline">plugin_version</span> 
symbols required by the SLURM Plugin API require no specialization for node selection support. 
Note carefully, however, the versioning discussion below.</p>

<p>A simplified flow of logic follows:
<pre>
slurmctld daemon starts
if (<i>select_p_state_restor)</i>() != SLURM_SUCCESS)
   abort

slurmctld reads the rest of its configuration and state information
if (<i>select_p_node_init</i>() != SLURM_SUCCESS)
   abort
if (<i>select_p_part_init</i>() != SLURM_SUCCESS)
   abort

wait for job 
if (<i>select_p_job_test</i>(all available nodes) != SLURM_SUCCESS) {
   if (<i>select_p_job_test</i>(all configured nodes) != SLURM_SUCCESS)
      reject the job and tell the user it can never run
   else
      leave the job queued for later execution
} else {
   update job's node list and node bitmap
   if (<i>select_p_job_begin</i>() != SLURM_SUCCESS)
      leave the job queued for later execution
   else {
      while (!<i>select_p_job_ready</i>())
        wait
      execute the job
      wait for job to end or be terminated
      <i>select_p_job_fini</i>()
    }
}

wait for slurmctld shutdown request
<i>select_p_state_save</i>()
</pre>
Depending upon failure modes, it is possible that 
<span class="commandline">select_p_state_save()</span>
will not be called at slurmctld terminatation.
When slurmctld is restarted, other function calls may be replayed.
<span class="commandline">select_p_node_init()</span> may be used 
to syncronize the plugin's state with that of slurmctld.</p>

<p class="footer"><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3>Data Objects</h3>
<p> These functions are expected to read and/or modify data structures directly in 
the slurmctld daemon's memory. Slurmctld is a multi-threaded program with independent 
read and write locks on each data structure type. Thererfore the type of operations 
permitted on various data structures is identified for each function.</p>

<p>These functions make use of bitmaps corresponding to the nodes in a table. 
The function <span class="commandline">select_p_node_init()</span> should 
be used to establish the initial mapping of bitmap entries to nodes. 
Functions defined in <i>src/common/bitmap.h</i> should be used for bitmap 
manipulations (these functions are directly accessible from the plugin).</p>

<p class="footer"><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h3>API Functions</h3>
<p>The following functions must appear. Functions which are not implemented should 
be stubbed.</p>

<h4>Global Node Selection Functions</h4>
<p class="commandline">int select_p_state_save (char *dir_name);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Save any global node selection state 
information to a file within the specified directory. The actual file name used is plugin specific. 
It is recommended that the global switch state contain a magic number for validation purposes. 
This function is called by the slurmctld deamon on shutdown.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:<span class="commandline"> dir_name</span>&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;(input) fully-qualified pathname of a directory into which user SlurmUser (as defined
in slurm.conf) can create a file and write state information into that file. Cannot be NULL.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful. On failure, 
the plugin should return SLURM_ERROR.</p>

<p class="commandline">int select_p_state_restore (char *dir_name);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Restore any global node selection state 
information from a file within the specified directory. The actual file name used is plugin specific. 
It is recommended that any magic number associated with the global switch state be verified. 
This function is called by the slurmctld deamon on startup.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:<span class="commandline"> dir_name</span>&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;(input) fully-qualified pathname of a directory containing a state information file 
from which user SlurmUser (as defined in slurm.conf) can read. Cannot be NULL.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful. On failure, 
the plugin should return SLURM_ERROR, causing slurmctld to exit.</p>

<p class="commandline">int select_p_node_init (struct node_record *node_ptr, int node_cnt);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Note the initialization of the node record data 
structure. This function is called when the node records are initially established and again 
when any nodes are added to or removed from the data structure. </p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:<br>
<span class="commandline"> node_ptr</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(input) pointer 
to the node data records. Data in these records can read. Nodes deleted after initiialization 
may have their the <i>name</i> field in the record cleared (zero length) rather than 
rebuilding the node records and bitmaps. <br>
<span class="commandline"> node_cnt</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input) number 
of node data records.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful. On failure, 
the plugin should return SLURM_ERROR, causing slurmctld to exit.</p>

<p class="commandline">int select_p_part_init (List part_list);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Note the initialization of the partition record data 
structure. This function is called when the partition records are initially established and again 
when any partition configurations change. </p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:
<span class="commandline"> part_list</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(input) list of partition 
record entries. Note that some of these partitions may have no associated nodes. Also 
consider that nodes can be removed from one partition and added to a different partition.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful. On failure, 
the plugin should return SLURM_ERROR, causing slurmctld to exit.</p>

<p class="commandline">int select_p_pack_node_info (time_t last_query_time, Buf *buffer_ptr);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: pack node specific information into a buffer.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:
<span class="commandline"> last_query_time</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(input) time that the data
was last saved. If it has not changed since this time, return SLURM_NO_CHANGE_IN_DATA. <br>
<span class="commandline"> buffer_ptre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(input/output) buffer into 
which the node data is appended.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful, 
SLURM_NO_CHANGE_IN_DATA if data has not changed since last packed, otherwise SLURM_ERROR</p>

<p class="footer"><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h4>Job-Specific Node Selection Functions</h4>
<p class="commandline">int select_p_job_test (struct job_record *job_ptr,
bitstr_t *bitmap, int min_nodes, int max_nodes);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Given a job's scheduling requirement 
specification and a set of nodes which might  be used to satisfy the request, identify 
the nodes which "best" satify the request. Note that nodes being considered for allocation 
to the job may include nodes already allocated to other jobs, even if node sharing is 
not permitted. This is done to ascertain whether or not job may be allocated resources 
at some later time (when the other jobs complete). This permits SLURM to reject 
non-runnable jobs at submit time rather than after they have spent hours queued. 
Informing users of problems at job submission time permits them to quickly resubmit 
the job with appropriate constraints.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:<br>
<span class="commandline"> job_ptr</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input) pointer 
to the job being considered for scheduling. Data in this job record may safely be read.
Data of particular interst include <i>details->contiguous</i> (set if allocated nodes 
should be contiguous), <i>num_procs</i> (minimum processors in allocation) and 
<i>details->req_node_bitmap</i> (specific required nodes).<br>
<span class="commandline"> bitmap</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input/output) 
bits representing nodes which might be allocated to the job are set on input.
This function should clear the bits representing nodes not required to satisfy 
job's scheduling request.
Bits left set will represent nodes to be used for this job. Note that the job's 
required nodes (<i>details->req_node_bitmap</i>) will be a superset 
<i>bitmap</i> when the function is called.<br>
<span class="commandline"> min_nodes</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input) 
minimum number of nodes to allocate to this job. Note this reflects both job 
and partition specifications.<br>
<span class="commandline"> max_nodes</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input) 
maximum number of nodes to allocate to this job. Note this reflects both job 
and partition specifications.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful. On failure,
the plugin should return SLURM_ERROR and future attempts may be made to schedule 
the job.</p>

<p class="commandline">int select_p_job_begin (struct job_record *job_ptr);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Note the initiation of the specified job
is about to begin. This function is called immediately after 
<span class="commandline">select_p_job_test()</span> sucessfully completes for this job.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:
<span class="commandline"> job_ptr</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input) pointer 
to the job being initialized. Data in this job record may safely be read or written.
The <i>nodes</i> and <i>node_bitmap</i> fields of this job record identify the 
nodes which have already been selected for this job to use. For an example of 
a job record field that the plugin may write into, see <i>select_id</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful. On failure,
the plugin should return SLURM_ERROR, which causes the job to be requeued for 
later execution.</p>

<p class="commandline">int select_p_job_ready (struct job_record *job_ptr);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Test if resources are configured 
and ready for job execution. This function is only used in the job prolog for 
BlueGene systems to determine if the bglblock has been booted and is ready for use.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:
<span class="commandline"> job_ptr</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input) pointer
to the job being initialized. Data in this job record may safely be read.
The <i>nodes</i> and <i>node_bitmap</i> fields of this job record identify the
nodes which have already been selected for this job to use. </p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: 1 if the job may begin execution, 
0 otherwise.</p>
 
<p class="commandline">int select_p_job_fini (struct job_record *job_ptr);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: Note the termination of the 
specified job. This function is called as the termination process for the 
job begins (prior to killing the tasks).</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>:
<span class="commandline"> job_ptr</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(input) pointer 
to the job being terminated. Data in this job record may safely be read or written.
The <i>nodes</i> and/or <i>node_bitmap</i> fields of this job record identify the 
nodes which were selected for this job to use.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if successful. On failure,
the plugin should return SLURM_ERROR.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p> This document describes version 0 of the SLURM node selection API. Future 
releases of SLURM may revise this API. A node selection plugin conveys its ability 
to implement a particular API version using the mechanism outlined for SLURM plugins. 
In addition, the credential is transmitted along with the version number of the 
plugin that transmitted it. It is at the discretion of the plugin author whether 
to maintain data format compatibility across different versions of the plugin.</p>
