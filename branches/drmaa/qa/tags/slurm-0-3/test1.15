# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test of wait option (--wait option).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
#
# Note:    This script generates and then deletes files in the working directory 
#          named test1.15.input, test1.15.output, and test1.15.error
