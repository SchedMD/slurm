Version 1.5 (2009-02-22)

    Make each "-" on the command line count as one hostlist argument.
    If multiple hostslists are given on stdin they are combined to a
    union hostlist before being used in the way requested by the
    options.

    Add hostgrep utility to search for lines matching a hostlist.

    Make the build system (used when building tar.gz and RPMs from the
    source code held in git) smarter.

Version 1.4 (2008-12-28)

    Support Python 3.

    Import reduce from functools if possible.
    Use Python 2/3 installation trick from .../Demo/distutils/test2to3

Version 1.3 (2008-09-30)

    Add -s/--separator, -p/--prepend, -a/--append and --version
    options contributed by Pär Andersson at NSC.

    Let -e be the short form of the --expand option (-w is now
    deprecated).

    Add a manual page for hostlist(1).

Version 1.2 (2008-09-18)

    Add "--prefix /usr" in the installation script of the spec file
    (needed on SUSE Linux where the default is /usr/local).

Version 1.1 (2008-09-17)

    Move the command line utility to a separate 'hostlist' command.

    Provide a python-hostlist.spec file to build RPM packages.
    Inspired by a contribution by Dr. Holger Obermaier at
