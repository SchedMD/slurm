=head1 NAME

B<qrerun> -  To rerun a job is to terminate the job and return the job to the queued state in the execution queue in which the job currently resides.
If a job is marked as not rerunable then the rerun request will fail for that job.

See the option on the qsub and qalter commands.

It is aimed to be feature-compatible with PBS' qsub.
