=head1 NAME

B<qhold> - places a hold on jobs in a familiar pbs format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<qhold> [B<-h> B<u>|B<o>|B<s>|B<n>] I<job_id>...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<qhold> command requests that a hold be placed on a job.  A job that is on hold is not eligible for execution.  There are three supported holds: USER, OTHER (also known as operator or batch), and SYSTEM.

If the B<-h> option is not specified, the USER hold will be applied to the specified jobs.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h> I<hold_type>

Specifieds the types of holds to be placed on the job.

The I<hold_type> argument is a one of the characters "u", "o", "s" or "n".  The hold type associated with each letter is:

    B<u> - USER

    B<o> - OTHER

    B<s> - SYSTEM

    B<n> - None

=item B<-? | --help>
