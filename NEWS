 This file describes changes in recent versions of Slurm. It primarily
documents those changes that are of interest to users and administrators.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.6
==========================
 -- If SchedulerParameters value of bf_min_age_reserve is configured, then
    a newly submitted job can start immediately even if there is a higher
    priority non-runnable job which has been waiting for less time than
    bf_min_age_reserve.
 -- qsub wrapper modified to export "all" with -V option
 -- RequeueExit and RequeueExitHold configuration parameters modified to accept
    numeric ranges. For example "RequeueExit=1,2,3,4" and "RequeueExit=1-4" are
    equivalent.
 -- Correct the job array specification parser to accept brackets in job array
    expression (e.g. "123_[4,7-9]").
 -- Fix for misleading job submit failure errors sent to users. Previous error
    could indicate why specific nodes could not be used (e.g. too small memory)
    when other nodes could be used, but were not for another reason.
 -- Fix squeue --array to display correctly the array elements when the
    % separator is specified at the array submission time.
 -- Fix priority from not being calculated correctly due to memory issues.
 -- Fix a transient pending reason 'JobId=job_id has invalid QOS'.
 -- A non-administrator change to job priority will not be persistent except
    for holding the job. User's wanting to change a job priority on a persistent
    basis should reset it's "nice" value.
 -- Print buffer sizes as unsigned values when failed to pack messages.
 -- Fix race condition where sprio would print factors without weights applied.
 -- Document the sacct option JobIDRaw which for arrays prints the jobid instead
    of the arrayTaskId.
 -- Allow users to modify MinCPUsNode, MinMemoryNode and MinTmpDiskNode of
    their own jobs.
 -- Increase the jobid print field in SQUEUE_FORMAT in
    opt_modulefiles_slurm.in.
 -- Enable compiling without optimizations and with debugging symbols by
    default. Disable this by configuring with --disable-debug.
 -- job_submit/lua plugin: Add mail_type and mail_user fields.
 -- Correct output message from sshare.
 -- Use standard statvfs(2) syscall if available, in preference to
    non-standard statfs.
 -- Add a new option -U/--Users to sshare to display only users
    information, parent and ancestors are not printed.
 -- Purge 50000 records at a time so that locks can released periodically.
 -- Fix potentially uninitialized variables
 -- ALPS - Fix issue where a frontend node could become unresponsive and never
    added back into the system.
 -- Gate epilog complete messages as done with other messages
 -- If we have more than a certain number of agents (50) wait longer when gating
    rpcs.
 -- FrontEnd - ping non-responding or down nodes.
 -- switch/cray: If CR_PACK_NODES is configured, then set the environment
    variable "PMI_CRAY_NO_SMP_ENV=1"
 -- Fix invalid memory reference in SlurmDBD when putting a node up.
 -- Allow opening of plugstack.conf even when a symlink.
 -- Fix scontrol reboot so that rebooted nodes will not be set down with reason
    'Node xyz unexpectedly rebooted' but will be correctly put back to service.
 -- CRAY - Throttle the post NHC operations as to not hog the job write lock
    if many steps/jobs finish at once.
 -- Disable changes to GRES count while jobs are running on the node.
 -- CRAY - Fix issue with scontrol reconfig.
 -- slurmd: Remove wrong reporting of "Error reading step  ... memory limit".
    The logic was treating success as an error.
 -- Eliminate "Node ping apparently hung" error messages.
 -- Fix average CPU frequency calculation.
 -- When allocating resources with resolution of sockets, charge the job for all
    CPUs on allocated sockets rather than just the CPUs on used cores.
 -- Prevent slurmdbd error if cluster added or removed while rollup in progress.
    Removing a cluster can cause slurmdbd to abort. Adding a cluster can cause
    the slurmdbd rollup to hang.
 -- sview - When right clicking on a tab make sure we don't display the page
    list, but only the column list.
 -- FRONTEND - If doing a clean start make sure the nodes are brought up in the
    database.
 -- MySQL - Fix issue when using the TrackSlurmctldDown and nodes are down at
    the same time, don't double bill the down time.
 -- MySQL - Various memory leak fixes.
 -- sreport - Fix Energy displays
 -- Fix node manager logic to keep unexpectedly rebooted node in state
    NODE_STATE_DOWN even if already down when rebooted.
 -- Fix for array jobs submitted to multiple partitions not starting.
 -- CRAY - Enable ALPs mpp compatibility code in sbatch for native Slurm.
 -- ALPS - Move basil_inventory to less confusing function.
 -- Add SchedulerParameters option of "sched_max_job_start="  to limit the
    number of jobs that can be started in any single execution of the main
    scheduling logic.
 -- Fixed compiler warnings generated by gcc version >= 4.6.
 -- sbatch to stop parsing script for "#SBATCH" directives after first command,
    which matches the documentation.
 -- Overwrite the SLURM_JOB_NAME in sbatch if already exist in the environment
    and use the one specified on the command line --job-name.
 -- Remove xmalloc_nz from unpack functions.  If the unpack ever failed the
    free afterwards would not have zeroed out memory on the variables that
    didn't get unpacked.
 -- Improve database interaction from controller.
 -- Fix for data shift when loading job archives.
 -- ALPS - Added new SchedulerParameters=inventory_interval to specify how
    often an inventory request is handled.
 -- ALPS - Don't run a release on a reservation on the slurmctld for a batch
    job.  This is already handled on the stepd when the script finishes.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.5
==========================
 -- Correct the squeue command taking into account that a node can
    have NULL name if it is not in DNS but still in slurm.conf.
 -- Fix slurmdbd regression which would cause a segfault when a node is set
    down with no reason.
 -- BGQ - Fix issue with job arrays not being handled correctly
    in the runjob_mux plugin.
 -- Print FAIR_TREE, if configured, in "scontrol show config" output for
    PriorityFlags.
 -- Add SLURM_JOB_GPUS environment variable to those available in the Prolog.
 -- Load lua-5.2 library if using lua5.2 for lua job submit plugin.

 -- Fix wrong variables used in the wrapper functions needed for systems that
    don't support strong_alias
 -- Fix code for apple computers SOL_TCP is not defined
 -- Cray/BASIL - Check for mysql credentials in /root/.my.cnf.
 -- Fix sprio showing wrong priority for job arrays until priority is
    recalculated.
 -- Account to batch step all CPUs that are allocated to a job not
    just one since the batch step has access to all CPUs like other steps.
 -- Fix job getting EligibleTime set before meeting dependency requirements.
 -- Correct the initialization of QOS MinCPUs per job limit.
 -- Set the debug level of information messages in cgroup plugin to debug2.
 -- For job running under a debugger, if the exec of the task fails, then
    cancel its I/O and abort immediately rather than waiting 60 seconds for
    I/O timeout.
 -- Fix associations not getting default qos set until after a restart.
 -- Set the value of total_cpus not to be zero before invoking
    acct_policy_job_runnable_post_select.
 -- MySQL - When requesting cluster resources, only return resources for the
    cluster(s) requested.
 -- Add TaskPluginParam=autobind=threads option to set a default binding in the
    case that "auto binding" doesn't find a match.
 -- Introduce a new SchedulerParameters variable nohold_on_prolog_fail.
    If configured don't requeue jobs on hold is a Prolog fails.
 -- Make it so sched_params isn't read over and over when an epilog complete
    message comes in
 -- Fix squeue -L <licenses> not filtering out jobs with licenses.
 -- Changed the implementation of xcpuinfo_abs_to_mac() be identical
    _abs_to_mac() to fix CPUs allocation using cpuset cgroup.
 -- Improve the explanation of the unbuffered feature in the
    srun man page.
 -- Make taskplugin=cgroup work for core spec.  needed to have task/cgroup
    before.
 -- Fix reports not using the month usage table.
 -- BGQ - Sanity check given for translating small blocks into slurm bg_records.
 -- Fix bug preventing the requeue/hold or requeue/special_exit of job from the
    completing state.
 -- Cray - Fix for launching batch step within an existing job allocation.
 -- Cray - Add ALPS_APP_ID_ENV environment variable.
 -- Increase maximum MaxArraySize configuration parameter value from 1,000,001
    to 4,000,001.
 -- Added new SchedulerParameters value of bf_min_age_reserve. The backfill
    scheduler will not reserve resources for pending jobs until they have
    been pending for at least the specified number of seconds. This can be
    valuable if jobs lack time limits or all time limits have the same value.
 -- Fix support for --mem=0 (all memory of a node) with select/cons_res plugin.
 -- Fix bug that can permit someone to kill job array belonging to another user.
 -- Don't set the default partition on a license only reservation.
 -- Show a NodeCnt=0, instead of NO_VAL, in "scontrol show res" for a license
    only reservation.
 -- BGQ - When using static small blocks make sure when clearing the job the
    block is set up to it's original state.
 -- Start job allocation using lowest numbered sockets for block task
    distribution for consistency with cyclic distribution.

 -- Fix the file name substitution for job stderr when %A, %a %j and %u
    are specified.
 -- Remove minor warning when compiling slurmstepd.
 -- Fix database resources so they can add new clusters to them after they have
    initially been added.
 -- Use the slurm_getpwuid_r wrapper of getpwuid_r to handle possible
    interrupts.
 -- Correct the scontrol man page and command listing which node states can
    be set by the command.
 -- Stop sacct from printing non-existent stat information for
    Front End systems.
 -- Correct srun and acct_gather.conf man pages, mention Filesystem instead
    of Lustre.
 -- When a job using multiple partition starts send to slurmdbd only
    the partition in which the job runs.
 -- ALPS - Fix depth for MemoryAllocation in BASIL with CLE 5.2.3.
 -- Fix assoc_mgr hash to deal with users that don't have a uid yet when making
    reservations.
 -- When a job uses multiple partition set the environment variable
    SLURM_JOB_PARTITION to be the one in which the job started.
 -- Print spurious message about the absence of cgroup.conf at log level debug2
    instead of info.
 -- Enable CUDA v7.0+ use with a Slurm configuration of TaskPlugin=task/cgroup
    ConstrainDevices=yes (in cgroup.conf). With that configuration
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES will start at 0 rather than the device number.
 -- Fix job array logic that can cause slurmctld to abort.
 -- Report job "shared" field properly in scontrol, squeue, and sview.
 -- If a job is requeued because of RequeueExit or RequeueExitHold sent event
    REQUEUED to slurmdbd.
 -- Fix build if hwloc is in non-standard location.
 -- Fix slurmctld job recovery logic which could cause the last task in a job
    array to be lost.
 -- Fix slurmctld initialization problem which could cause requeue of the last
    task in a job array to fail if executed prior to the slurmctld loading
    the maximum size of a job array into a variable in the job_mgr.c module.
 -- Fix fatal in controller when deleting a user association of a user which
    had been previously removed from the system.
 -- MySQL - If a node state and reason are the same on a node state change
    don't insert a new row in the event table.
 -- Fix issue with "sreport cluster AccountUtilizationByUser" when using
    PrivateData=users.
 -- Fix perlapi tests for libslurm perl module.
 -- MySQL - Fix potential issue when PrivateData=Usage and a normal user
    runs certain sreport reports.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.3
==========================
 -- Prevent vestigial job record when canceling a pending job array record.
 -- Fixed squeue core dump.
 -- Fix job array hash table bug, could result in slurmctld infinite loop or
    invalid memory reference.
 -- In srun honor ntasks_per_node before looking at cpu count when the user
    doesn't request a number of tasks.
 -- Fix ghost job when submitting job after all jobids are exhausted.
 -- MySQL - Enhanced coordinator security checks.
 -- Fix for task/affinity if an admin configures a node for having threads
    but then sets CPUs to only represent the number of cores on the node.
 -- Make it so previous versions of salloc/srun work with newer versions
    of Slurm daemons.
 -- Avoid delay on commit for PMI rank 0 to improve performance with some
    MPI implementations.
 -- auth/munge - Correct logic to read old format AccountingStoragePass.
 -- Reset node "RESERVED" state as appropriate when deleting a maintenance
    reservation.
 -- Prevent a job manually suspended from being resumed by gang scheduler once
    free resources are available.

    scheduling.
 -- Fixes for clean build on FreeBSD.
 -- Fix documentation bugs in slurm.conf.5. DenyAccount should be DenyAccounts.
 -- For backward compatibility with older versions of OMPI not compiled
    with --with-pmi restore the SLURM_STEP_RESV_PORTS in the job environment.
 -- Update the html documentation describing the integration with openmpi.

 -- Fix race condition that could start a job that is dependent upon a job array
    before all tasks of that job array complete.
 -- PMI2 race condition fix.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.2
==========================
 -- Fix Centos5 compile errors.
 -- Fix issue with association hash not getting the correct index which
    could result in seg fault.
 -- Fix salloc/sbatch -B segfault.
 -- Avoid huge malloc if GRES configured with "Type" and huge "Count".
 -- Fix jobs from starting in overlapping reservations that won't finish before
    a "maint" reservation begins.
 -- When node gets drained while in state mixed display its status as draining
    in sinfo output.
 -- Allow priority/multifactor to work with sched/wiki(2) if all priorities
    have no weight.  This allows for association and QOS decay limits to work.
 -- Fix "squeue --start" to override SQUEUE_FORMAT env variable.
 -- Fix scancel to be able to cancel multiple jobs that are space delimited.
 -- Log Cray MPI job calling exit() without mpi_fini(), but do not treat it as
    a fatal error. This partially reverts logic added in version 14.03.9.
 -- sview - Fix displaying of suspended steps elapsed times.
 -- Increase number of messages that get cached before throwing them away
    when the DBD is down.
 -- Fix jobs from starting in overlapping reservations that won't finish before

    version  14.03.10.
 -- Fix bug with GRES having multiple types that can cause slurmctld abort.
 -- Fix squeue issue with not recognizing "localhost" in --nodelist option.
 -- Make sure the bitstrings for a partitions Allow/DenyQOS are up to date
    when running from cache.

 -- Fix possible race condition when attempting to use QOS on a system running
    accounting_storage/filetxt.
 -- Fix issue with accounting_storage/filetxt and job arrays not being printed
    correctly.
 -- In proctrack/linuxproc and proctrack/pgid, check the result of strtol()
    for error condition rather than errno, which might have a vestigial error
    code.
 -- Improve information recording for jobs deferred due to advanced
    reservation.
 -- Exports eio_new_initial_obj to the plugins and initialize kvs_seq on
    mpi/pmi2 setup to support launching.

==========================
 -- Get libs correct when doing the xtree/xhash make check.
 -- Update xhash/tree make check to work correctly with current code.
 -- Remove the reference 'experimental' for the jobacct_gather/cgroup
    plugin.
 -- Add QOS manipulation examples to the qos.html documentation page.
 -- If 'squeue -w node_name' specifies an unknown host name print
    an error message and return 1.
 -- Fix race condition in job_submit plugin logic that could cause slurmctld to
    deadlock.
 -- Job wait reason of "ReqNodeNotAvail" expanded to identify unavailable nodes
    (e.g. "ReqNodeNotAvail(Unavailable:tux[3-6])").

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0

 -- Allow multiple partitions to be specified in sinfo -p.
 -- Install the service files in /usr/lib/systemd/system.

 -- In the memory cgroup enable memory.use_hierarchy in the cgroup root.
 -- Export eio.c functions for use by MPI/PMI2.
 -- Add SLURM_CLUSTER_NAME to job environment.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0rc3
=============================
 -- Allow envs to override autotools binaries in autogen.sh
 -- Added system services files.
 -- If the jobs pends with DependencyNeverSatisfied keep it pending even after
    the job which it was depending upon was cleaned.
 -- Let operators (in addition to user root and SlurmUser) see job script for
    other user's jobs.
 -- Perl API modified to return node state of MIXED rather than ALLOCATED if
    only some CPUs allocated.
 -- Double Munge connect retry timeout from 1 to 2 seconds.
 -- sview - Remove unneeded code that was resolved globally in commit
    98e24b0dedc.
 -- Collect and report the accounting of the batch step and its children.
 -- Add configure checks for faccessat and eaccess, and make use of one of
    them if available.
 -- Make configure --enable-developer also set --enable-debug
 -- Introduce a SchedulerParameters variable kill_invalid_depend, if set
    then jobs pending with invalid dependency are going to be terminated.
 -- Move spank_user_task() call in slurmstepd after the task_g_pre_launch()
    so that the task affinity information is available to spank.
 -- Make /etc/init.d/slurm script return value 3 when the daemon is
    not running. This is required by Linux Standard Base Core
    Specification 3.1

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0rc2
=============================
 -- Logs for jobs which are explicitly requeued will say so rather than saying
    that a node in their allocation failed.
 -- Updated the documentation about the remote licenses served by
    the Slurm database.
 -- Insure that slurm_spank_exit() is only called once from srun.
 -- Change the signature of net_set_low_water() to use 4 bytes instead of 8.
 -- Export working_cluster_rec in libslurmdb.so as well as move some function
    definitions needed for drmaa.
 -- If using cons_res or serial cause a fatal in the plugin instead of causing
    the SelectTypeParameters to magically set to CR_CPU.
 -- Enhance task/affinity auto binding to consider tasks * cpus-per-task.
 -- Fix regression the priority/multifactor which would cause memory corruption.
    Issue is only in rc1.
 -- Add PrivateData value of "cloud". If set, powered down nodes in the cloud
    will be visible.
 -- Sched/backfill - Eliminate clearing start_time of running jobs.
 -- Fix various backwards compatibility issues.
 -- If failed to launch a batch job, requeue it in hold.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0rc1
=============================
 -- When using cgroup name the batch step as step_batch instead of
    batch_4294967294
 -- Changed LEVEL_BASED priority to be "Fair_Tree"
 -- Port to NetBSD.
 -- BGQ - Add cnode based reservations.
 -- Alongside totalview_jobid implement totalview_stepid available
    to sattach.
 -- Add ability to include other files in slurm.conf based upon the ClusterName.
 -- Update strlcpy to latest upstream version.
 -- Add reservation information in the sacct and sreport output.
 -- Add job priority calculation check for overflow and fix memory leak.
 -- Add SchedulerParameters option of pack_serial_at_end to put serial jobs at
    the end of the available nodes rather than using a best fit algorithm.
 -- Allow regular users to view default sinfo output when
    privatedata=reservations is set.
 -- PrivateData=reservation modified to permit users to view the reservations
    which they have access to (rather then preventing them from seeing ANY
    reservation).
 -- job_submit/lua: Fix job_desc set field logic

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0pre5
==============================
 -- Fix sbatch --export=ALL, it was treated by srun as a request to explicitly
    export only the environment variable named "ALL".
 -- Improve scheduling of jobs in reservations that overlap other reservations.
 -- Modify sgather to make global file systems easier to configure.
 -- Added sacctmgr reconfig to reread the slurmdbd.conf in the slurmdbd.
 -- Modify scontrol job operations to accept comma delimited list of job IDs.
    Applies to job update, hold, release, suspend, resume, requeue, and
    requeuehold operations.
 -- Refactor job_submit/lua interface. LUA FUNCTIONS NEED TO CHANGE! The
    lua script no longer needs to explicitly load meta-tables, but information
    is available directly using names slurm.reservations, slurm.jobs,
    slurm.log_info, etc. Also, the job_submit.lua script is reloaded when
    updated without restarting the slurmctld daemon.
 -- Allow users to specify --resv_ports to have value 0.
 -- Cray MPMD (Multiple-Program Multiple-Data) support completed.
 -- Added ability for "scontrol update" to references jobs by JobName (and
    filtered optionally by UserID).
 -- Add support for an advanced reservation start time that remains constant
    relative to the current time. This can be used to prevent the starting of
    longer running jobs on select nodes for maintenance purpose. See the
    reservation flag "TIME_FLOAT" for more information.
 -- Enlarge the jobid field to 18 characters in squeue output.
 -- Added "scontrol write config" option to save a copy of the current
    configuration in a file containing a time stamp.
 -- Eliminate native Cray specific port management. Native Cray systems must
    now use the MpiParams configuration parameter to specify ports to be used
    for commmunications. When upgrading Native Cray systems from version 14.03,
    all running jobs should be killed and the switch_cray_state file (in
    SaveStateLocation of the nodes where the slurmctld daemon runs) must be
    explicitly deleted.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0pre4
==============================
 -- Added job array data structure and removed 64k array size restriction.
 -- Added SchedulerParameters options of bf_max_job_array_resv to control how
    many tasks of a job array should have resources reserved for them.
 -- Added more validity checking of incoming job submit requests.
 -- Added srun --export option to set/export specific environment variables.
 -- Scontrol modified to print separate error messages for job arrays with
    different exit codes on the different tasks of the job array. Applies to
    job suspend and resume operations.
 -- Fix race condition in CPU frequency set with job preemption.
 -- Always call select plugin on step termination, even if the job is also
    complete.
 -- Srun executable names beginning with "." will be resolved based upon the
    working directory and path on the compute node rather than the submit node.
 -- Add node state string suffix of "$" to identify nodes in maintenance
    reservation or scheduled for reboot. This applies to scontrol, sinfo,
    and sview commands.
 -- Enable scontrol to clear a nodes's scheduled reboot by setting its state
    to "RESUME".
 -- As per sbatch and srun documentation when the --signal option is used
    signal only the steps and unless, in the case, of a batch job B is
    specified in which case signal only the batch script.
 -- Modify AuthInfo configuration parameter to accept credential lifetime
    option.
 -- Modify crypto/munge plugin to use socket and timeout specified in AuthInfo.
 -- If we have a state for a step on completion put that in the database
    instead of guessing off the exit_code.
 -- Added squeue -P/--priority option that can be used to display pending jobs
    in the same order as used by the Slurm scheduler even if jobs are submitted
    to multiple partitions (job is reported once per usable partition).
 -- Improve the pending reason description for various QOS limits. For each
    QOS limit that causes a job to be pending print its specific reason.
    For example if job pends because of GrpCpus the squeue command will
    print QOSGrpCpuLimit as pending reason.
 -- sched/backfill - Set expected start time of job submitted to multiple
    partitions to the earliest start time on any of the partitions.
 -- Introduce a MAX_BATCH_REQUEUE define that indicates how many times a job
    can be requeued upon prolog failure. When the number is reached the job
    is put on hold with reason JobHoldMaxRequeue.
 -- Add sbatch job array option to limit the number of simultaneously running
    tasks from a job array (e.g. "--array=0-15%4").
 -- Implemented a new QOS limit MinCPUs. Users running under a QOS must
    request a minimum number of CPUs which is at least MinCPUs otherwise
    their job will pend.
 -- Introduced a new pending reason WAIT_QOS_MIN_CPUS to reflect the new QOS
    limit.
 -- Job array dependency based upon state is now dependent upon the state of
    the array as a whole (e.g. afterok requires ALL tasks to complete
    sucessfully, afternotok is true if ANY tasks does not complete successfully,
    and after requires all tasks to at least be started).
 -- The srun -u/--unbuffered options set the stdout of the task launched
    by srun to be line buffered.
 -- The srun options -/--label and -u/--unbuffered can be specified together.
    This limitation has been removed.
 -- Provide sacct display of gres accounting information per job.
 -- Change the node status size from uin16_t to uint32_t.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0pre3
==============================
 -- Move xcpuinfo.[c|h] to the slurmd since it isn't needed anywhere else
    and will avoid the need for all the daemons to link to libhwloc.
 -- Add memory test to job_submit/partition plugin.
 -- Added new internal Slurm functions xmalloc_nz() and xrealloc_nz(), which do
    not initialize the allocated memory to zero for improved performance.
 -- Modify hostlist function to dynamically allocate buffer space for improved
    performance.
 -- In the job_submit plugin: Remove all slurmctld locks prior to job_submit()
    being called for improved performance. If any slurmctld data structures are
    read or modified, add locks directly in the plugin.
 -- Added PriorityFlag LEVEL_BASED described in doc/html/level_based.shtml
 -- If Fairshare=parent is set on an account, that account's children will be
    effectively reparented for fairshare calculations to the first parent of
    their parent that is not Fairshare=parent.  Limits remain the same,
    only it's fairshare value is affected.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0pre2
==============================
 -- Added AllowSpecResourcesUsage configuration parameter in slurm.conf. This
    allows jobs to use specialized resources on nodes allocated to them if the
    job designates --core-spec=0.
 -- Add new SchedulerParameters option of build_queue_timeout to throttle how
    much time can be consumed building the job queue for scheduling.
 -- Added HealthCheckNodeState option of "cycle" to cycle through the compute
    nodes over the course of HealthCheckInterval rather than running all at
    the same time.
 -- Add job "reboot" option for Linux clusters. This invokes the configured
    RebootProgram to reboot nodes allocated to a job before it begins execution.
 -- Added squeue -O/--Format option that makes all job and step fields available
    for printing.
 -- Improve database slurmctld entry speed dramatically.
 -- Add "CPUs" count to output of "scontrol show step".
 -- Add support for lua5.2
 -- scancel -b signals only the batch step neither any other step nor any
    children of the shell script.
 -- MySQL - enforce NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
 -- Added CpuFreqDef configuration parameter in slurm.conf to specify the
    default CPU frequency and governor to be set at job end.
 -- Added support for job email triggers: TIME_LIMIT, TIME_LIMIT_90 (reached
    90% of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_80 (reached 80% of time limit), and
    TIME_LIMIT_50 (reached 50% of time limit). Applies to salloc, sbatch and
    srun commands.
 -- In slurm.conf add the parameter SrunPortRange=min-max. If this is configured
    then srun will use its dynamic ports only from the configured range.
 -- Make debug_flags 64 bit to handle more flags.

* Changes in Slurm 14.11.0pre1
==============================
 -- Modify etc/cgroup.release_common.example to set specify full path to the
    scontrol command. Also find cgroup mount point by reading cgroup.conf file.
 -- Improve qsub wrapper support for passing environment variables.
 -- Modify sdiag to report Slurm RPC traffic by user, type, count and time
    consumed.
 -- In select plugins, stop triggering extra logging based upon the debug flag
    CPU_Bind and use SelectType instead.
 -- Added SchedulerParameters options of bf_yield_interval and bf_yield_sleep
    to control how frequently and for how long the backfill scheduler will
    relinquish its locks.
 -- To support larger numbers of jobs when the StateSaveDirectory is on a
    file system that supports a limited number of files in a directory, add a
    subdirectory called "hash.#" based upon the last digit of the job ID.
 -- More gracefully handle missing batch script file. Just kill the job and do
    not drain the compute node.
 -- Add support for allocation of GRES by model type for heterogenous systems
    (e.g. request a Kepler GPU, a Tesla GPU, or a GPU of any type).
 -- Record and enable display of nodes anticipated to be used for pending jobs.
 -- Modify squeue --start option to print the nodes expected to be used for
    pending job (in addition to expected start time, etc.).
 -- Add association hash to the assoc_mgr.
 -- Better logic to handle resized jobs when the DBD is down.
 -- Introduce MemLimitEnforce yes|no in slurm.conf. If set no Slurm will
    not terminate jobs if they exceed requested memory.
 -- Add support for non-consumable generic resources for resources that are
    limited, but can be shared between jobs.
 -- Introduce 5 new Slurm errors in slurm_errno.h related to job to better
    report error conditions.
 -- Modify scontrol to print error message for each array task when updating
    the entire array.
 -- Added gres_drain and gres_used fields to node_info_t.
 -- Added PriorityParameters configuration parameter in slurm.conf.
 -- Introduce automatic job requeue policy based on exit value. See RequeueExit
    and RequeueExitHold descriptions in slurm.conf man page.
 -- Modify slurmd to cache launched job IDs for more responsive job suspend and
    gang scheduling.
 -- Permit jobs steps full control over cpu_bind options if specialized cores
    are included in the job allocation.
 -- Added ChosLoc configuration parameter to specifiy the pathname of the
    Chroot OS tool.
 -- Sent SIGCONT/SIGTERM when a job is selected for preemption with GraceTime
    configured rather than waiting for GraceTime to be reached before notifying
    the job.
 -- Do not resume a job with specialized cores on a node running another job
    with specialized cores (only one can run at a time).
 -- Add specialized core count to job suspend/resume calls.
 -- task/affinity and task/cgroup - Correct specialized core task binding with
    user supplied invalid CPU mask or map.
 -- Add srun --cpu-freq options to set the CPU governor (OnDemand, Performance,
    PowerSave or UserSpace).
 -- Add support for a job step's CPU governor and/or frequency to be reset on
    suspend/resume (or gang scheduling). The default for an idle CPU will now
    be "ondemand" rather than "userspace" with the lowest frequency (to recover
    from hard slurmd failures and support gang scheduling).
 -- Added PriorityFlags option of Calulate_Running to continue recalculating
    the priority of running jobs.
 -- Replace round-robin front-end node selection with least-loaded algorithm.
 -- CRAY - Improve support of XC30 systems when running natively.
 -- Add new node configuration parameters CoreSpecCount, CPUSpecList and
    MemSpecLimit which support the reservation of resources for system use
    with Linux cgroup.
 -- Add child_forked() function to the slurm_acct_gather_profile plugin to
    close open files, leaving application with no extra open file descriptors.
 -- Cray/ALPS system - Enable backup controller to run outside of the Cray to
    accept new job submissions and most other operations on the pending jobs.
 -- Have sacct print job and task array id's for job arrays.
 -- Smooth out fanout logic
 -- If <sys/prctl.h> is present name major threads in slurmctld, for
    example backfill
    thread: slurmctld_bckfl, the rpc manager: slurmctld_rpcmg etc.
    The name can be seen for example using top -H.
 -- sview - Better job_array support.
 -- Provide more precise error message when job allocation can not be satisfied
    (e.g. memory, disk, cpu count, etc. rather than just "node configuration
    not available").
 -- Create a new DebugFlags named TraceJobs in slurm.conf to print detailed
    information about jobs in slurmctld. The information include job ids, state
    and node count.
 -- When a job dependency can never be satisfied do not cancel the job but keep
    pending with reason WAIT_DEP_INVALID (DependencyNeverSatisfied).

* Changes in Slurm 14.03.12
===========================
 -- Make it so previous versions of salloc/srun work with newer versions
    of Slurm daemons.
 -- PMI2 race condition fix.
 -- Avoid delay on commit for PMI rank 0 to improve performance with some
    MPI implementations.
 -- Correct the sbatch pbs parser to process -j.

    (changed starting in 5.2.3).
 -- ALPS - Fix issue when tracking memory on a PerNode basis instead of
    PerCPU.

    lock was locked outside of the function or not.
 -- Give even better estimates on pending node count if no node count
    is requested.
 -- Fix jobcomp/mysql plugin for MariaDB 10+/Mysql 5.6+ to work with reserved
    work "partition".

    an maintenance reservation that is not active yet.
 -- Fix issue where exclusive allocations wouldn't lay tasks out correctly
    with CR_PACK_NODES.
 -- Do not requeue a batch job from slurmd daemon if it is killed while in
    the process of being launched (a race condition introduced in v14.03.9).

 -- Double max string that Slurm can pack from 16MB to 32MB to support
    larger MPI2 configurations.
 -- Fix Centos5 compile issues.
 -- Log Cray MPI job calling exit() without mpi_fini(), but do not treat it as
    a fatal error. This partially reverts logic added in version 14.03.9.
 -- sview - Fix displaying of suspended steps elapsed times.
 -- Increase number of messages that get cached before throwing them away
    when the DBD is down.
 -- Fix jobs from starting in overlapping reservations that won't finish before
    a "maint" reservation begins.
 -- Fix "squeue --start" to override SQUEUE_FORMAT env variable.

    error.
 -- Correct sched_config.html documentation SchedulingParameters
    should be SchedulerParameters.
 -- When using gres and cgroup ConstrainDevices set correct access
    permission for the batch step.
 -- Fix minor memory leak in jobcomp/mysql on slurmctld reconfig.
 -- Fix bug that prevented preservation of a job's GRES bitmap on slurmctld
    restart or reconfigure (bug was introduced in 14.03.5 "Clear record of a
    job's gres when requeued" and only applies when GRES mapped to specific
    files).
 -- BGQ: Fix race condition when job fails due to hardware failure and is
    requeued. Previous code could result in slurmctld abort with NULL pointer.
 -- Prevent negative job array index, which could cause slurmctld to crash.
 -- Fix issue with squeue/scontrol showing correct node_cnt when only tasks
    are specified.
 -- Check the status of the database connection before using it.

    different number of dimensions than the cluster.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix invalid pointer in corner case in the plugin.
 -- Make sure on a reconfigure the select information for a node is preserved.
 -- Correct logic to support job GRES specification over 31 bits (problem
    in logic converting int to uint32_t).

    needed when GRES mapped to specific files).
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix sinfo -tr before it would only print idle nodes correctly.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for licenses_only reservation on bluegene systems.
 -- sview - Verify pointer before using strchr.
 -- -M option on tools talking to a Cray from a non-Cray fixed.
 -- CRAY - Fix rpmbuild issue for missing file slurm.conf.template.

    SuspendProgram/ResumeProgram even if previously executed for that node.
 -- Fix logic determining when job configuration (i.e. running node power up
    logic) is complete.
 -- Setting the state of a node in powered down state node to "resume" will
    no longer cause it to reboot, but only clear the "drain" state flag.
 -- Fix srun documentation to remove SLURM_NODELIST being equivalent as the -w
    option (since it isn't).
 -- Fix issue with --hint=nomultithread and allocations with steps running
    arbitrary layouts (test1.59).
 -- PrivateData=reservation modified to permit users to view the reservations
    which they have access to (rather then preventing them from seeing ANY
    reservation).  Backport from 14.11 commit 77c2bd25c.
 -- Fix PrivateData=reservation when using associations to give privileges to
    a reservation.
 -- Better checking to see if select plugin is linear or not.

    did the ALPS reservation.
 -- Safer check to avoid invalid reads when shutting down the slurmctld with
    lots of jobs.
 -- Fix minor memory leak in the backfill scheduler when shutting down.
 -- Add ArchiveResvs to the output of sacctmgr show config and init the variable
    on slurmdbd startup.
 -- SLURMDBD - Only set the archive flag if purging the object
    (i.e ArchiveJobs PurgeJobs).  This is only a cosmetic change.

    restart.
 -- If failed to launch a batch job requeue it in hold.

* Changes in Slurm 14.03.8
==========================
 -- Fix minor memory leak when Job doesn't have nodes on it (Meaning the job
    has finished)
 -- Fix sinfo/sview to be able to query against nodes in reserved and other
    states.
 -- Make sbatch/salloc read in (SLURM|(SBATCH|SALLOC))_HINT in order to
    handle sruns in the script that will use it.
 -- srun properly interprets a leading "." in the executable name based upon
    the working directory of the compute node rather than the submit host.
 -- Fix Lustre misspellings in hdf5 guide
 -- Fix wrong reference in slurm.conf man page to what --profile option should
    be used for AcctGatherFilesystemType.
 -- Update HDF5 document to point out the SlurmdUser is who creates the
    ProfileHDF5Dir directory as well as all it's sub-directories and files.
 -- CRAY NATIVE - Remove error message for srun's ran inside an salloc that
    had --network= specified.
 -- Defer job step initiation of required GRES are in use by other steps rather
    than immediately returning an error.
 -- Deprecate --cpu_bind from sbatch and salloc.  These never worked correctly
    and only caused confusion since the cpu_bind options mostly refer to a
    step we opted to only allow srun to set them in future versions.
 -- Modify sgather to work if Nodename and NodeHostname differ.
 -- Changed use of JobContainerPlugin where it should be JobContainerType.
 -- Fix for possible error if job has GRES, but the step explicitly requests a
    GRES count of zero.
 -- Make "srun --gres=none ..." work when executed without a job allocation.
 -- Change the global eio_shutdown_time to a field in eio handle.
 -- Advanced reservation fixes for heterogeneous systems, especially when
    reserving cores.
 -- If --hint=nomultithread is used in a job allocation make sure any srun's
    ran inside the allocation can read the environment correctly.
 -- If batchdir can't be made set errno correctly so the slurmctld is notified
    correctly.
 -- Remove repeated batch complete if batch directory isn't able to be made
    since the slurmd will send the same message.
 -- sacctmgr fix default format for list transactions.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix backfill issue with backfilling jobs on blocks already
    reserved for higher priority jobs.
 -- When creating job arrays the job specification files for each elements
    are hard links to the first element specification files. If the controller
    fails to make the links the files are copied instead.
 -- Fix error handling for job array create failure due to inability to copy
    job files (script and environment).
 -- Added patch in the contribs directory for integrating make version 4.0 with
    Slurm and renamed the previous patch "make-3.81.slurm.patch".
 -- Don't wait for an update message from the DBD to finish before sending rc
    message back.  In slow systems with many associations this could speed
    responsiveness in sacctmgr after adding associations.
 -- Eliminate race condition in enforcement of MaxJobCount limit for job arrays.
 -- Fix anomaly allocating cores for GRES with specific device/CPU mapping.
 -- cons_res - When requesting exclusive access make sure we set the number
    of cpus in the job_resources_t structure so as nodes finish the correct
    cpu count is displayed in the user tools.
 -- If the job_submit plugin calls take longer than 1 second to run, print a
    warning.
 -- Make sure transfer_s_p_options transfers all the portions of the
    s_p_options_t struct.

    SLURM_CPU_BIND_LIST environment variable are set only when task/affinity
    plugin is configured.
 -- sacct - Initialize variables correctly to avoid incorrect structure
    reference.
 -- Performance adjustment to avoid calling a function multiple times when it
    only needs to be called once.
 -- Give more correct waiting reason if job is waiting on association/QOS
    MaxNode limit.
 -- DB - When sending lft updates to the slurmctld only send non-deleted lfts.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix documentation on how to build a reservation less than
    a midplane.
 -- If Slurmctld fails to read the job environment consider it an error
    and abort the job.
 -- Add the name of the node a job is running on to the message printed by
    slurmstepd when terminating a job.
 -- Remove unsupported options from sacctmgr help and the dump function.
 -- Update sacctmgr man page removing reference to obsolete parameter
    MaxProcSecondsPerJob.
 -- Added more validity checking of incoming job submit requests.

* Changes in Slurm 14.03.7
==========================
 -- Correct typos in man pages.
 -- Add note to MaxNodesPerUser and multiple jobs running on the same node
    counting as multiple nodes.
 -- PerlAPI - fix renamed call from slurm_api_set_conf_file to
    slurm_conf_reinit.
 -- Fix gres race condition that could result in job deallocation error message.
 -- Correct NumCPUs count for jobs with --exclusive option.
 -- When creating reservation with CoreCnt, check that Slurm uses
    SelectType=select/cons_res, otherwise don't send the request to slurmctld
    and return an error.
 -- Save the state of scheduled node reboots so they will not be lost should the
    slurmctld restart.
 -- In select/cons_res plugin - Insure the node count does not exceed the task
    count.
 -- switch/nrt - Do not explicitly unload windows for a job on termination,
    only unload its table (which automatically unloads its windows).
 -- When HealthCheckNodeState is configured as IDLE don't run the
    HealthCheckProgram for nodes in any other states than IDLE.
 -- Remove all slurmctld locks prior to job_submit() being called in plugins.
    If any slurmctld data structures are read or modified, add locks directly
    in the plugin.
 -- Minor sanity check to verify the string sent in isn't NULL when using
    bit_unfmt.
 -- CRAY NATIVE - Fix issue on heavy systems to only run the NHC once per
    job/step completion.
 -- Remove unneeded step cleanup for pending steps.
 -- Fix issue where if a batch job was manually requeued the batch step
    information wasn't stored in accounting.
 -- When job is release from a requeue hold state clean up its previous
    exit code.
 -- Correct the srun man page about how the output from the user application
    is sent to srun.
 -- Increase the timeout of the main thread while waiting for the i/o thread.
    Allow up to 180 seconds for the i/o thread to complete.
 -- When using sacct -c to read the job completion data compute the correct
    job elapsed time.
 -- Perl package: Define some missing node states.
 -- When using AccountingStorageType=accounting_storage/mysql zero out the
    database index for the array elements avoiding duplicate database values.
 -- Reword the explanation of cputime and cputimeraw in the sacct man page.
 -- JobCompType allows "jobcomp/mysql" as valid name but the code used
    "job_comp/mysql" setting an incorrect default database.
 -- Try to load libslurm.so only when necessary.
 -- When nodes scheduled for reboot, set state to DOWN rather than FUTURE so
    they are still visible to sinfo. State set to IDLE after reboot completes.
 -- Apply BatchStartTimeout configuration to task launch and avoid aborting
    srun commands due to long running Prolog scripts.
 -- Fix minor memory leaks when freeing node_info_t structure.
 -- Fix various memory leaks in sview
 -- If a batch script is requeued and running steps get correct exit code/signal
    previous it was always -2.
 -- If step exitcode hasn't been set display with sacct the -2 instead
    of acting like it is a signal and exitcode.
 -- Send calculated step_rc for batch step instead of raw status as
    done for normal steps.
 -- If a job times out, set the exit code in accounting to 1 instead of the
    signal 1.
 -- Update the acct_gather.conf.5 man page removing the reference to
    InfinibandOFEDFrequency.
 -- Fix gang scheduling for jobs submitted to multiple partitions.
 -- Enable srun to submit job to multiple partitions.
 -- Update slurm.conf man page. When Epilog or Prolog fail the node state
    is set ro DRAIN.
 -- Start a job in the highest priority partition possible, even if it requires
    preempting other jobs and delaying initiation, rather than using a lower
    priority partition. Previous logic would preempt lower priority jobs, but
    then might start the job in a lower priority partition and not use the
    resources released by the preempted jobs.
 -- Fix SelectTypeParameters=CR_PACK_NODES for srun making both job and step
    resource allocation.
 -- BGQ - Make it possible to pack multiple tasks on a core when not using
    the entire cnode.
 -- MYSQL - if unable to connect to mysqld close connection that was inited.
 -- DBD - when connecting make sure we wait MessageTimeout + 5 since the
    timeout when talking to the Database is the same timeout so a race
    condition could occur in the requesting client when receiving the response
    if the database is unresponsive.

* Changes in Slurm 14.03.6
==========================

 -- Differentiate between two identical debug messages about purging vestigial
    job scripts.
 -- If the socket used by slurmstepd to communicate with slurmd exist when
    slurmstepd attempts to create it, for example left over from a previous
    requeue or crash, delete it and recreate it.

    that is submitted to multiple partitions.
 -- Report correct CPU count allocated to job when allocated whole node even if
    not using all CPUs.
 -- If job's constraints cannot be satisfied put it in pending state with reason
    BadConstraints and don't remove it.
 -- sched/backfill - If job started with infinite time limit, set its end_time
    one year in the future.
 -- Clear record of a job's gres when requeued.
 -- Clear QOS GrpUsedCPUs when resetting raw usage if QOS is not using any cpus.

    failure as well as interactive user.
 -- Modify test4.5 to only look at one partition instead of all of them.
 -- Fix sh5util -u to accept username different from the user that runs the
    command.
 -- Corrections to man pages:salloc.1 sbatch.1 srun.1 nonstop.conf.5
    slurm.conf.5.

    and should there be problems accessing the state files.

* Changes in Slurm 14.03.4
==========================
 -- Fix issue where not enforcing QOS but a partition either allows or denies
    them.
 -- CRAY - Make switch/cray default when running on a Cray natively.
 -- CRAY - Make job_container/cncu default when running on a Cray natively.
 -- Disable job time limit change if it's preemption is in progress.
 -- Correct logic to properly enforce job preemption GraceTime.
 -- Fix sinfo -R to print each down/drained node once, rather than once per
    partition.
 -- If a job has non-responding node, retry job step create rather than
    returning with DOWN node error.
 -- Support SLURM_CONF path which does not have "slurm.conf" as the file name.
 -- CRAY - make job_container/cncu default when running on a Cray natively
 -- Fix issue where batch cpuset wasn't looked at correctly in
    jobacct_gather/cgroup.
 -- Correct squeue's job node and CPU counts for requeued jobs.
 -- Correct SelectTypeParameters=CR_LLN with job selecition of specific nodes.
 -- Only if ALL of their partitions are hidden will a job be hidden by default.
 -- Run EpilogSlurmctld for a job is killed during slurmctld reconfiguration.
 -- Close window with srun if waiting for an allocation and while printing
    something you also get a signal which would produce deadlock.
 -- Add SelectTypeParameters option of CR_PACK_NODES to pack a job's tasks
    tightly on its allocated nodes rather than distributing them evenly across
    the allocated nodes.
 -- cpus-per-task support: Try to pack all CPUs of each tasks onto one socket.
    Previous logic could spread the tasks CPUs across multiple sockets.
 -- Add new distribution method fcyclic so when a task is using multiple cpus
    it can bind cyclically across sockets.
 -- task/affinity - When using --hint=nomultithread only bind to the first
    thread in a core.
 -- Make cgroup task layout (block | cyclic) method mirror that of
    task/affinity.
 -- If TaskProlog sets SLURM_PROLOG_CPU_MASK reset affinity for that task
    based on the mask given.
 -- Keep supporting 'srun -N x --pty bash' for historical reasons.
 -- If EnforcePartLimits=Yes and QOS job is using can override limits, allow
    it.
 -- Fix issues if partition allows or denies account's or QOS' and either are
    not set.
 -- If a job requests a partition and it doesn't allow a QOS or account the
    job is requesting pend unless EnforcePartLimits=Yes.  Before it would
    always kill the job at submit.
 -- Fix format output of scontrol command when printing node state.
 -- Improve the clean up of cgroup hierarchy when using the
    jobacct_gather/cgroup plugin.
 -- Added SchedulerParameters value of Ignore_NUMA.
 -- Fix issues with code when using automake 1.14.1
 -- select/cons_res plugin: Fix memory leak related to job preemption.
 -- After reconfig rebuild the job node counters only for jobs that have
    not finished yet, otherwise if requeued the job may enter an invalid
    COMPLETING state.
 -- Do not purge the script and environment files for completed jobs on
    slurmctld reconfiguration or restart (they might be later requeued).
 -- scontrol now accepts the option job=xxx or jobid=xxx for the requeue,
    requeuehold and release operations.
 -- task/cgroup - fix to bind batch job in the proper CPUs.
 -- Added strigger option of -N, --noheader to not print the header when
    displaying a list of triggers.
 -- Modify strigger to accept arguments to the program to execute when an
    event trigger occurs.
 -- Attempt to create duplicate event trigger now generates ESLURM_TRIGGER_DUP
    ("Duplicate event trigger").
 -- Treat special characters like %A, %s etc. literally in the file names
    when specified escaped e.g. sbatch -o /home/zebra\\%s will not expand
    %s as the stepid of the running job.
 -- CRAYALPS - Add better support for CLE 5.2 when running Slurm over ALPS.
 -- Test time when job_state file was written to detect multiple primary
    slurmctld daemons (e.g. both backup and primary are functioning as
    primary and there is a split brain problem).
 -- Fix scontrol to accept update jobid=# numtasks=#
 -- If the backup slurmctld assumes primary status, then do NOT purge any
    job state files (batch script and environment files) and do not re-use them.
    This may indicate that multiple primary slurmctld daemons are active (e.g.
    both backup and primary are functioning as primary and there is a split
    brain problem).
 -- Set correct error code when requeuing a completing/pending job
 -- When checking for if dependency of type afterany, afterok and afternotok
    don't clear the dependency if the job is completing.
 -- Cleanup the JOB_COMPLETING flag and eventually requeue the job when the
    last epilog completes, either slurmd epilog or slurmctld epilog, whichever
    comes last.
 -- When attempting to requeue a job distinguish the case in which the job is
    JOB_COMPLETING or already pending.
 -- When reconfiguring the controller don't restart the slurmctld epilog if it
    is already running.
 -- Email messages for job array events print now use the job ID using the
    format "#_# (#)" rather than just the internal job ID.
 -- Set the number of free licenses to be 0 if the global license count
    decreases and total is less than in use.
 -- Add DebugFlag of BackfillMap. Previously a DebugFlag value of Backfill
    logged information about what it was doing plus a map of expected resouce
    use in the future. Now that very verbose resource use map is only logged
    with a DebugFlag value of BackfillMap
 -- Fix slurmstepd core dump.
 -- Modify the description of -E and -S option of sacct command as point in time
    'before' or 'after' the database records are returned.
 -- Correct support for partition with Shared=YES configuration.
 -- If job requests --exclusive then do not use nodes which have any cores in an
    advanced reservation. Also prevents case where nodes can be shared by other
    jobs.
 -- For "scontrol --details show job" report the correct CPU_IDs when thre are
    multiple threads per core (we are translating a core bitmap to CPU IDs).
 -- If DebugFlags=Protocol is configured in slurm.conf print details of the
    connection, ip address and port accepted by the controller.
 -- Fix minor memory leak when reading in incomplete node data checkpoint file.
 -- Enlarge the width specifier when printing partition SHARE to display larger
    sharing values.
 -- sinfo locks added to prevent possibly duplicate record printing for
    resources in multiple partitions.

============================
 -- BGQ - Fix issue with uninitialized variable.

* Changes in Slurm 14.03.3

 -- Correction to default batch output file name. In version 14.03.2 was using
    "slurm_<jobid>_4294967294.out" due to error in job array logic.
 -- In slurm.spec file, replace "Requires cray-MySQL-devel-enterprise" with
    "Requires mysql-devel".

* Changes in Slurm 14.03.2
==========================
 -- Fix race condition if PrologFlags=Alloc,NoHold is used.
 -- Cray - Make NPC only limit running other NPC jobs on shared blades instead
    of limited non NPC jobs.

 -- Fix job dependency bug. Jobs dependent upon multiple other jobs may start
    prematurely.
 -- Set "Reason" field for all elements of a job array on short-circuited
    scheduling for job arrays.
 -- Allow -D option of salloc/srun/sbatch to specify relative path.
 -- Added SchedulerParameter of batch_sched_delay to permit many batch jobs
    to be submitted between each scheduling attempt to reduce overhead of
    scheduling logic.
 -- Added job reason of "SchedTimeout" if the scheduler was not able to reach
    the job to attempt scheduling it.
 -- Add job's exit state and exit code to email message.
 -- scontrol hold/release accepts job name option (in addition to job ID).
 -- Handle when trying to cancel a step that hasn't started yet better.
 -- Handle Max/GrpCPU limits better

 -- Fix segfault of sacct -c if spaces are in the variables.
 -- Release held job only with "scontrol release <jobid>" and not by resetting
    the job's priority. This is needed to support job arrays better.
 -- Correct squeue command not to merge jobs with state pending and completing
    together.
 -- Fix issue where user is requesting --acctg-freq=0 and no memory limits.
 -- Fix issue with GrpCPURunMins if a job's timelimit is altered while the job
    is running.
 -- Temporary fix for handling our typemap for the perl api with newer perl.

 -- Add "Scheduling Configuration Guide" web page.
 -- BGQ - fix check for jobinfo when it is NULL
 -- Do not check cleaning on "pending" steps.
 -- task/cgroup plugin - Fix for building on older hwloc (v1.0.2).

    Set the SLURM_PMI_KVS_DUP_KEYS if you want the code to check for
    duplicate keys.
 -- Add job submission time to squeue.
 -- Permit user root to propagate resource limits higher than the hard limit
    slurmd has on that compute node has (i.e. raise both current and maximum
    limits).
 -- Fix issue with license used count when doing an scontrol reconfig.
 -- Fix the PMI iterator to not report duplicated keys.
 -- Fix issue with sinfo when -o is used without the %P option.
 -- Rather than immediately invoking an execution of the scheduling logic on
    every event type that can enable the execution of a new job, queue its
    execution. This permits faster execution of some operations, such as
    modifying large counts of jobs, by executing the scheduling logic less
    frequently, but still in a timely fashion.
 -- If the environment variable is greater than MAX_ENV_STRLEN don't
    set it in the job env otherwise the exec() fails.
 -- Optimize scontrol hold/release logic for job arrays.
 -- Modify srun to report an exit code of zero rather than nine if some tasks
    exit with a return code of zero and others are killed with SIGKILL. Only an
    exit code of zero did this.

    restarted.
 -- Make sure a job's prolog has ran before starting a step.
 -- BGQ - Fix invalid memory read when using DefaultConnType in the
    bluegene.conf
 -- Make sure we send node state to the DBD on clean start of controller.
 -- Fix some sinfo and squeue sorting anomalies due to differences in data
    types.
 -- Only send message back to slurmctld when PrologFlags=Alloc is used on a
    Cray/ALPS system, otherwise use the slurmd to wait on the prolog to gate
    the start of the step.
 -- Remove need to check PrologFlags=Alloc in slurmd since we can tell if prolog
    has ran yet or not.
 -- Fix squeue to use a correct macro to check job state.
 -- BGQ - Fix incorrect logic issues if MaxBlockInError=0 in the bluegene.conf.
 -- priority/basic - Insure job priorities continue to decrease when jobs are
    submitted with the --nice option.
 -- Make the PrologFlag=Alloc work on batch scripts
 -- Make PrologFlag=NoHold (automatically sets PrologFlag=Alloc) not hold in
    salloc/srun, instead wait in the slurmd when a step hits a node and the
    prolog is still running.
 -- Added --cpu-freq=highm1 (high minus one) option.

 -- When updating jobs verify the update request is not identical to
    the current settings.
 -- When sorting jobs and priorities are equal sort by job_id.
 -- Do not overwrite existing reason for node being down or drained.
 -- Requeue batch job if Munge is down and credential can not be created.
 -- Make _slurm_init_msg_engine() tolerate bug in bind() returning a busy
    ephemeral port.
 -- Don't block scheduling of entire job array if it could run in multiple
    partitions.
 -- Introduce a new debug flag Protocol to print protocol requests received
    together with the remote IP address and port.
 -- CRAY - Set up the network even when only using 1 node.
 -- CRAY - Greatly reduce the number of error messages produced from the task
    plugin and provide more information in the message.

    reservation, but can not due to busy resources, then do not block all jobs
    in that partition from being scheduled, but only the jobs in that
    reservation.
 -- Export "SLURM*" environment variables from sbatch even if --export=NONE.

 -- Make job array expressions more flexible to accept multiple step counts in
    the expression (e.g. "--array=1-10:2,50-60:5,123").
 -- switch/cray - add state save/restore logic tracking allocated ports.
 -- SchedulerParameters - Replace max_job_bf with bf_max_job_start (both will

    hostlist_push_host().
 -- Modify the reading of lustre file system statistics to print more
    information when debug and when io error occur.
 -- Add specialized core count field to job credential data.
    NOTE: This changes the communications protocol from other pre-releases of

 -- Convert bitmap functions to use int32_t instead of int in data structures
    and function arguments. This is to reliably enable use of bitmaps containing
    up to 4 billion elements. Several data structures containing index values
    were also changed from data type int to int32_t:

    code of 0xfffffffe if the slurmd on node zero registers its active jobs at
    the same time that slurmstepd is recording the job's exit code.
 -- Correct logic returning remaining job dependencies in job information
    reported by scontrol and squeue. Eliminates vestigial descriptors with

    exceedingly rare.)
 -- HDF5 - Fix minor memory leak.
 -- Slurmstepd variable initialization - Without this patch, free() is called
    on a random memory location (i.e. whatever is on the stack), which can
    result in slurmstepd dying and a completed job not being purged in a
    timely fashion.
 -- Fix slurmstepd race condition when separate threads are reading and
    modifying the job's environment, which can result in the slurmstepd failing
    with an invalid memory reference.

 -- BGQ - Fix issue if user runs multiple sub-block jobs inside a multiple
    midplane block that starts on a higher coordinate than it ends (i.e if a

    filters out CPUs that can not use the GRES, next picks CPUs for the job,
    and finally picks the GRES that best match those CPUs.

    requeued or aborted.
 -- Validate a job's accounting frequency at submission time rather than
    waiting for it's initiation to possibly fail.
 -- Fix CPURunMins if a job is requeued from a failed launch.

 -- Added "PriorityFlags" value of "SMALL_RELATIVE_TO_TIME". If set, the job's
    size component will be based upon not the job size alone, but the job's
    size divided by it's time limit.
 -- Added sbatch option "--ignore-pbs" to ignore "#PBS" options in the batch
    script.
 -- Rename slurm_step_ctx_params_t field from "mem_per_cpu" to "pn_min_memory".
    Job step now accepts memory specification in either per-cpu or per-node
    basis.
 -- Add ability to specify host repitition count in the srun hostfile (e.g.
    "host1*2" is equivalent to "host1,host1").

* Changes in Slurm 2.6.0pre3
============================
 -- Add milliseconds to default log message header (both RFC 5424 and ISO 8601
    time formats). Disable milliseconds logging using the configure
    parameter "--disable-log-time-msec". Default time format changes to
    ISO 8601 (without time zone information). Specify "--enable-rfc5424time"
    to restore the time zone information.
 -- Add username (%u) to the filename pattern in the batch script.
 -- Added options for front end nodes of AllowGroups, AllowUsers, DenyGroups,
    and DenyUsers.
 -- Fix sched/backfill logic to initiate jobs with maximum time limit over the
    partition limit, but the minimum time limit permits it to start.
 -- gres/gpu - Fix for gres.conf file with multiple files on a single line
    using a slurm expression (e.g. "File=/dev/nvidia[0-1]").
 -- Replaced ipmi.conf with generic acct_gather.conf file for all acct_gather
    plugins.  For those doing development to use this follow the model set
    forth in the acct_gather_energy_ipmi plugin.
 -- Added more options to update a step's information
 -- Add DebugFlags=ThreadID which will print the thread id of the calling
    thread.
 -- CRAY - Allocate whole node (CPUs) in reservation despite what the
    user requests.  We have found any srun/aprun afterwards will work on a
    subset of resources.

* Changes in Slurm 2.6.0pre2
============================
 -- Do not purge inactive interactive jobs that lack a port to ping (added
    for MR+ operation).
 -- Advanced reservations with hostname and core counts now supports asymetric
    reservations (e.g. specific different core count for each node).
 -- Added slurmctld/dynalloc plugin for MapReduce+ support.
 -- Added "DynAllocPort" configuration parameter.
 -- Added partition paramter of SelectTypeParameters to override system-wide
    value.
 -- Added cr_type to partition_info data structure.
 -- Added allocated memory to node information available (within the existing
    select_nodeinfo field of the node_info_t data structure). Added Allocated
    Memory to node information displayed by sview and scontrol commands.
 -- Make sched/backfill the default scheduling plugin rather than sched/builtin
    (FIFO).
 -- Added support for a job having different priorities in different partitions.
 -- Added new SchedulerParameters configuration parameter of "bf_continue"
    which permits the backfill scheduler to continue considering jobs for
    backfill scheduling after yielding locks even if new jobs have been
    submitted. This can result in lower priority jobs from being backfill
    scheduled instead of newly arrived higher priority jobs, but will permit
    more queued jobs to be considered for backfill scheduling.
 -- Added support to purge reservation records from accounting.
 -- Cray - Add support for Basil 1.3

* Changes in SLURM 2.6.0pre1
============================
 -- Add "state" field to job step information reported by scontrol.
 -- Notify srun to retry step creation upon completion of other job steps
    rather than polling. This results in much faster throughput for job step
    execution with --exclusive option.
 -- Added "ResvEpilog" and "ResvProlog" configuration parameters to execute a
    program at the beginning and end of each reservation.
 -- Added "slurm_load_job_user" function. This is a variation of
    "slurm_load_jobs", but accepts a user ID argument, potentially resulting
    in substantial performance improvement for "squeue --user=ID"
 -- Added "slurm_load_node_single" function. This is a variation of
    "slurm_load_nodes", but accepts a node name argument, potentially resulting
    in substantial performance improvement for "sinfo --nodes=NAME".
 -- Added "HealthCheckNodeState" configuration parameter identify node states
    on which HealthCheckProgram should be executed.
 -- Remove sacct --dump --formatted-dump options which were deprecated in
    2.5.
 -- Added support for job arrays (phase 1 of effort). See "man sbatch" option
    -a/--array for details.
 -- Add new AccountStorageEnforce options of 'nojobs' and 'nosteps' which will
    allow the use of accounting features like associations, qos and limits but
    not keep track of jobs or steps in accounting.
 -- Cray - Add new cray.conf parameter of "AlpsEngine" to specify the
    communication protocol to be used for ALPS/BASIL.
 -- select/cons_res plugin: Correction to CPU allocation count logic in for
    cores without hyperthreading.
 -- Added new SelectTypeParameter value of "CR_ALLOCATE_FULL_SOCKET".
 -- Added PriorityFlags value of "TICKET_BASED" and merged priority/multifactor2
    plugin into priority/multifactor plugin.
 -- Add "KeepAliveTime" configuration parameter controlling how long sockets
    used for srun/slurmstepd communications are kept alive after disconnect.
 -- Added SLURM_SUBMIT_HOST to salloc, sbatch and srun job environment.
 -- Added SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID to environment of job array.
 -- Added squeue --array/-r option to optimize output for job arrays.
 -- Added "SlurmctldPlugstack" configuration parameter for generic stack of
    slurmctld daemon plugins.
 -- Removed contribs/arrayrun tool. Use native support for job arrays.
 -- Modify default installation locations for RPMs to match "make install":
    _prefix /usr/local
    _slurm_sysconfdir %{_prefix}/etc/slurm
    _mandir %{_prefix}/share/man
    _infodir %{_prefix}/share/info
 -- Add acct_gather_energy/ipmi which works off freeipmi for energy gathering

* Changes in Slurm 2.5.8
========================
 -- Fix for slurmctld segfault on NULL front-end reason field.
 -- Avoid gres step allocation errors when a job shrinks in size due to either
    down nodes or explicit resizing. Generated slurmctld errors of this type:
    "step_test ... gres_bit_alloc is NULL"
 -- Fix bug that would leak memory and over-write the AllowGroups field if on
    "scontrol reconfig" when AllowNodes is manually changed using scontrol.
 -- Get html/man files to install in correct places with rpms.
 -- Remove --program-prefix from spec file since it appears to be added by
    default and appeared to break other things.
 -- Updated the automake min version in autogen.sh to be correct.
 -- Select/cons_res - Correct total CPU count allocated to a job with
    --exclusive and --cpus-per-task options
 -- switch/nrt - Don't allocate network resources unless job step has 2+ nodes.
 -- select/cons_res - Avoid extraneous "oversubscribe" error messages.
 -- Reorder get config logic to avoid deadlock.
 -- Enforce QOS MaxCPUsMin limit when job submission contains no user-specified
    time limit.
 -- EpilogSlurmctld pthread is passed required arguments rather than a pointer
    to the job record, which under some conditions could be purged and result
    in an invalid memory reference.

* Changes in Slurm 2.5.7
========================
 -- Fix for linking to the select/cray plugin to not give warning about
    undefined variable.
 -- Add missing symbols to the xlator.h
 -- Avoid placing pending jobs in AdminHold state due to backfill scheduler
    interactions with advanced reservation.
 -- Accounting - make average by task not cpu.
 -- CRAY - Change logging of transient ALPS errors from error() to debug().
 -- POE - Correct logic to support poe option "-euidevice sn_all" and
    "-euidevice sn_single".
 -- Accounting - Fix minor initialization error.
 -- POE - Correct logic to support srun network instances count with POE.
 -- POE - With the srun --launch-cmd option, report proper task count when
    the --cpus-per-task option is used without the --ntasks option.
 -- POE - Fix logic binding tasks to CPUs.
 -- sview - Fix race condition where new information could of slipped past
    the node tab and we didn't notice.
 -- Accounting - Fix an invalid memory read when slurmctld sends data about
    start job to slurmdbd.
 -- If a prolog or epilog failure occurs, drain the node rather than setting it
    down and killing all of its jobs.
 -- Priority/multifactor - Avoid underflow in half-life calculation.
 -- POE - pack missing variable to allow fanout (more than 32 nodes)
 -- Prevent clearing reason field for pending jobs. This bug was introduced in
    v2.5.5 (see "Reject job at submit time ...").
 -- BGQ - Fix issue with preemption on sub-block jobs where a job would kill
    all preemptable jobs on the midplane instead of just the ones it needed to.
 -- switch/nrt - Validate dynamic window allocation size.
 -- BGQ - When --geo is requested do not impose the default conn_types.
 -- CRAY - Support CLE 4.2.0
 -- RebootNode logic - Defers (rather than forgets) reboot request with job
    running on the node within a reservation.
 -- switch/nrt - Correct network_id use logic. Correct support for user sn_all
    and sn_single options.
 -- sched/backfill - Modify logic to reduce overhead under heavy load.
 -- Fix job step allocation with --exclusive and --hostlist option.
 -- Select/cons_res - Fix bug resulting in error of "cons_res: sync loop not
    progressing, holding job #"
 -- checkpoint/blcr - Reset max_nodes from zero to NO_VAL on job restart.
 -- launch/poe - Fix for hostlist file support with repeated host names.
 -- priority/multifactor2 - Prevent possible divide by zero.
 -- srun - Don't check for executable if --test-only flag is used.
 -- energy - On a single node only use the last task for gathering energy.
    Since we don't currently track energy usage per task (only per step).
    Otherwise we get double the energy.

* Changes in Slurm 2.5.6
========================
 -- Gres fix for requeued jobs.
 -- Gres accounting - Fix regression in 2.5.5 for keeping track of gres
    requested and allocated.

* Changes in Slurm 2.5.5
========================
 -- Fix for sacctmgr add qos to handle the 'flags' option.
 -- Export SLURM_ environment variables from sbatch, even if "--export"
    option does not explicitly list them.
 -- If node is in more than one partition, correct counting of allocated CPUs.
 -- If step requests more CPUs than possible in specified node count of job
    allocation then return ESLURM_TOO_MANY_REQUESTED_CPUS rather than
    ESLURM_NODES_BUSY and retrying.
 -- CRAY - Fix SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE to be set correctly.
 -- Accounting - more checks for strings with a possible `'` in it.

 -- Cray - Disable enforcement of MaxTasksPerNode, which is not applicable
    with launch/aprun.
 -- Accounting - When rolling up data from past usage ignore "idle" time from
    a reservation when it has the "Ignore_Jobs" flag set.  Since jobs could run
    outside of the reservation in it's nodes without this you could have
    double time.
 -- Accounting - Minor fix to avoid reuse of variable erroneously.
 -- Reject job at submit time if the node count is invalid. Previously such a
    job submitted to a DOWN partition would be queued.
 -- Purge vestigial job scripts when the slurmd cold starts or slurmstepd
    terminates abnormally.
 -- Add support for FreeBSD.
 -- Add sanity check for NULL cluster names trying to register.

    while it was free cnodes would go into software error and kill the job.
 -- BGQ - Fix issue where if for some reason we are freeing a block with
    a pending job on it we don't kill the job.
 -- BGQ - Fix race condition were a job could of been removed from a block
    without it still existing there.  This is extremely rare.
 -- BGQ - Fix for when a step completes in Slurm before the runjob_mux notifies
    the slurmctld there were software errors on some nodes.
 -- BGQ - Fix issue on state recover if block states are not around
    and when reading in state from DB2 we find a block that can't be created.
    You can now do a clean start to rid the bad block.
 -- Modify slurmdbd to retransmit to slurmctld daemon if it is not responding.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix issue where when doing backfill preemptable jobs were
    never looked at to determine eligibility of backfillable job.
 -- Cray/BlueGene - Disable srun --pty option unless LaunchType=launch/slurm.
 -- CRAY - Fix sanity check for systems with more than 32 cores per node.
 -- CRAY - Remove other objects from MySQL query that are available from
    the XML.

    isn't a sub-block job.
 -- Cray - avoid check of macro versions of CLE for version 5.0.
 -- CRAY - Fix memory issue with reading in the cray.conf file.
 -- CRAY - If hostlist is given with srun make sure the node count is the same
    as the hosts given.

    per node in the BASIL reservation request.
 -- CRAY - fix issue with --mem option not giving correct amount of memory
    per cpu.

    the option when used with --launch-cmd.
 -- Change sview to use GMutex instead of GStaticMutex
 -- CRAY - set APRUN_DEFAULT_MEMROY instead of CRAY_AUTO_APRUN_OPTIONS
 -- sview - fix issue where if a partition was completely in one state the
    cpu count would be reflected correctly.
 -- BGQ - fix for handling half rack system in STATIC of OVERLAP mode to
    implicitly create full system block.
 -- CRAY - Dynamically create BASIL XML buffer to resize as needed.
 -- Fix checking if QOS limit MaxCPUMinsPJ is set along with DenyOnLimit to
    deny the job instead of holding it.
 -- Make sure on systems that use a different launcher than launch/slurm not
    to attempt to signal tasks on the frontend node.
 -- Cray - when a step is requested count other steps running on nodes in the
    allocation as taking up the entire node instead of just part of the node
    allocated.  And always enforce exclusive on a step request.
 -- Cray - display correct nodelist, node/cpu count on steps.

* Changes in Slurm 2.5.4
========================
 -- Fix bug in PrologSlurmctld use that would block job steps until node
    responds.
 -- CRAY - If a partition has MinNodes=0 and a batch job doesn't request nodes
    put the allocation to 1 instead of 0 which prevents the allocation to
    happen.
 -- Better debug when the database is down and using the --cluster option in
    the user commands.
 -- When asking for job states with sacct, default to 'now' instead of midnight
    of the current day.
 -- Fix for handling a test-only job or immediate job that fails while being
    built.

    handle interruption
 -- BGQ - Able to handle when midplanes go into Hardware::SoftwareFailure
 -- GRES - Correct tracking of specific resources used after slurmctld restart.
    Counts would previously go negative as jobs terminate and decrement from
    a base value of zero.
 -- Fix for priority/multifactor2 plugin to not assert when configured with
    --enable-debug.
 -- Select/cons_res - If the job request specified --ntasks-per-socket and the
    allocation using is cores, then pack the tasks onto the sockets up to the
    specified value.
 -- BGQ - If a cnode goes into an 'error' state and the block containing the
    cnode does not have a job running on it do not resume the block.

    slurm.NO_VAL, etc.
 -- Fix topology/tree logic when nodes defined in slurm.conf get re-ordered.
 -- In select/cons_res, correct logic to allocate whole sockets to jobs. Work
    by Magnus Jonsson, Umea University.
 -- In select/cons_res, correct logic when job removed from only some nodes.
 -- Avoid apparent kernel bug in 2.6.32 which apparently is solved in
    at least 3.5.0.  This avoids a stack overflow when running jobs on
    more than 120k nodes.
 -- BLUEGENE - If we made a block that isn't runnable because of a overlapping
    block, destroy it correctly.
 -- Switch/nrt - Dynamically load libnrt.so from within the plugin as needed.
    This eliminates the need for libnrt.so on the head node.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix in reservation logic that could cause abort.

* Changes in SLURM 2.5.1
========================
 -- Correction to hostlist sorting for hostnames that contain two numeric
    components and the first numeric component has various sizes (e.g.
    "rack9blade1" should come before "rack10blade1")

 -- BLUEGENE - Fix issue with preemption when needing to preempt multiple jobs
    to make one job run.
 -- Fixed issue where if an srun dies inside of an allocation abnormally it
    would of also killed the allocation.
 -- FRONTEND - fixed issue where if a systems nodes weren't defined in the
    slurm.conf with NodeAddr's signals going to a step could be handled
    incorrectly.
 -- If sched/backfill starts a job with a QOS having NO_RESERVE and not job
    time limit, start it with the partition time limit (or one year if the
    partition has no time limit) rather than NO_VAL (140 year time limit);
 -- Alter hostlist logic to allocate large grid dynamically instead of on
    stack.
 -- Change RPC version checks to support version 2.5 slurmctld with version 2.4
    slurmd daemons.

    request resources that reach a 'Max' limit.
 -- Permit SlurmUser or operator to change QOS of non-pending jobs (e.g.
    running jobs).
 -- BGQ - move initial poll to beginning of realtime interaction, which will
    also cause it to run if the realtime server ever goes away.

* Changes in SLURM 2.5.0-rc2
============================
 -- Modify sbcast logic to survive slurmd daemon restart while file a
    transmission is in progress.

    deamon is under very heavy load (e.g. with 1000 slurmd daemons per compute
    node).
 -- Add launch and acct_gather_energy plugins to RPMs.
 -- Restore support for srun "--mpi=list" option.

    where needed)
 -- If the PrologSlurmctld fails, then requeue the job an indefinite number
    of times instead of only one time.

 -- Intel MIC processor support added using gres/mic plugin. BIG thanks to
    Olli-Pekka Lehto, CSC-IT Center for Science Ltd.
 -- Accounting - Change empty jobacctinfo structs to not actually be used
    instead of putting 0's into the database we put NO_VALS and have sacct
    figure out jobacct_gather wasn't used.
 -- Cray - Prevent calling basil_confirm more than once per job using a flag.
 -- Fix bug with topology/tree and job with min-max node count. Now try to
    get max node count rather than minimizing leaf switches used.
 -- Add AccountingStorageEnforce=safe option to provide method to avoid jobs
    launching that wouldn't be able to run to completion because of a
    GrpCPUMins limit.
 -- Add support for RFC 5424 timestamps in logfiles. Disable with configuration
    option of "--disable-rfc5424time". By Janne Blomqvist, Aalto University.
 -- CRAY - Replace srun.pl with launch/aprun plugin to use srun to wrap the
    aprun process instead of a perl script.

    Bull.
 -- Force slurmd exit after 2 minute wait, even if threads are hung.
 -- Change node_req field in struct job_resources from 8 to 32 bits so we can
    run more than 256 jobs per node.
 -- sched/backfill: Improve accuracy of expected job start with respect to
    reservations.
 -- sinfo partition field size will be set the the length of the longest
    partition name by default.
 -- Make it so the parse_time will return a valid 0 if given epoch time and
    set errno == ESLURM_INVALID_TIME_VALUE on error instead.
 -- Correct srun --no-alloc logic when node count exceeds node list or task
    task count is not a multiple of the node count. Work by Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Completed integration with IBM Parallel Environment including POE and IBM's
    NRT switch library.

* Changes in SLURM 2.5.0.pre2
=============================
 -- When running with multiple slurmd daemons per node, enable specifying a
    range of ports on a single line of the node configuration in slurm.conf.
 -- Add reservation flag of Part_Nodes to allocate all nodes in a partition to
    a reservation and automatically change the reservation when nodes are
    added to or removed from the reservation. Based upon work by
    Bill Brophy, Bull.
 -- Add support for advanced reservation for specific cores rather than whole
    nodes. Current limiations: homogeneous cluster, nodes idle when reservation
    created, and no more than one reservation per node. Code is still under
    development. Work by Alejandro Lucero Palau, et. al, BSC.
 -- Add DebugFlag of Switch to log switch plugin details.
 -- Correct job node_cnt value in job completion plugin when job fails due to
    down node. Previously was too low by one.
 -- Add new srun option --cpu-freq to enable user control over the job's CPU
    frequency and thus it's power consumption. NOTE: cpu frequency is not
    currently preserved for jobs being suspended and later resumed. Work by
    Don Albert, Bull.
 -- Add node configuration information about "boards" and optimize task
    placement on minimum number of boards. Work by Rod Schultz, Bull.

* Changes in SLURM 2.5.0.pre1
=============================
 -- Add new output to "scontrol show configuration" of LicensesUsed. Output is
    "name:used/total"
 -- Changed jobacct_gather plugin infrastructure to be cleaner and easier to
    maintain.
 -- Change license option count separator from "*" to ":" for consistency with
    the gres option (e.g. "--licenses=foo:2 --gres=gpu:2"). The "*" will still
    be accepted, but is no longer documented.
 -- Permit more than 100 jobs to be scheduled per node (new limit is 250
    jobs).
 -- Restructure of srun code to allow outside programs to utilize existing
    logic.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.6
========================
 -- Correct WillRun authentication logic when issued for non-job owner.
 -- BGQ - fix memory leak
 -- BGQ - Fix to check block for action 'D' if it also has nodes in error.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.5
========================
 -- Cray - On job kill requeust, send SIGCONT, SIGTERM, wait KillWait and send
    SIGKILL. Previously just sent SIGKILL to tasks.
 -- BGQ - Fix issue when running srun outside of an allocation and only
    specifying the number of tasks and not the number of nodes.
 -- BGQ - validate correct ntasks_per_node
 -- BGQ - when srun -Q is given make runjob be quiet
 -- Modify use of OOM (out of memory protection) for Linux 2.6.36 kernel
    or later. NOTE: If you were setting the environment variable
    SLURMSTEPD_OOM_ADJ=-17, it should be set to -1000 for Linux 2.6.36 kernel
    or later.
 -- BGQ - Fix job step timeout actually happen when done from within an
    allocation.
 -- Reset node MAINT state flag when a reservation's nodes or flags change.
 -- Accounting - Fix issue where QOS usage was being zeroed out on a
    slurmctld restart.
 -- BGQ - Add 64 tasks per node as a valid option for srun when used with
    overcommit.
 -- BLUEGENE - With Dynamic layout mode - Fix issue where if a larger block
    was already in error and isn't deallocating and underlying hardware goes
    bad one could get overlapping blocks in error making the code assert when
    a new job request comes in.
 -- BGQ - handle pending actions on a block better when trying to deallocate it.
 -- Accounting - Fixed issue where if nodenames have changed on a system and
    you query against that with -N and -E you will get all jobs during that
    time instead of only the ones running on -N.
 -- BGP - Fix for HTC mode
 -- Accounting - If a job start message fails to the SlurmDBD reset the db_inx
    so it gets sent again.  This isn't a major problem since the start will
    happen when the job ends, but this does make things cleaner.
 -- If an salloc is waiting for an allocation to happen and is canceled by the
    user mark the state canceled instead of completed.
 -- Fix issue in accounting if a user puts a '\' in their job name.
 -- Accounting - Fix for if asking for users or accounts that were deleted
    with associations get the deleted associations as well.
 -- BGQ - Handle shared blocks that need to be removed and have jobs running
    on them.  This should only happen in extreme conditions.
 -- Fix inconsistency for hostlists that have more than 1 range.
 -- BGQ - Add mutex around recovery for the Real Time server to avoid hitting
    DB2 so hard.
 -- BGQ - If an allocation exists on a block that has a 'D' action on it fail
    job on future step creation attempts.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.4
========================
 -- BGQ - minor fix to make build work in emulated mode.
 -- BGQ - Fix if large block goes into error and the next highest priority jobs
    are planning on using the block.  Previously it would fail those jobs
    erroneously.
 -- BGQ - Fix issue when a cnode going to an error (not SoftwareError) state
    with a job running or trying to run on it.
 -- Execute slurm_spank_job_epilog when there is no system Epilog configured.
 -- Fix for srun --test-only to work correctly with timelimits
 -- BGQ - If a job goes away while still trying to free it up in the
    database, and the job is running on a small block make sure we free up
    the correct node count.
 -- BGQ - Logic added to make sure a job has finished on a block before it is
    purged from the system if its front-end node goes down.
 -- Modify strigger so that a filter option of "--user=0" is supported.
 -- Correct --mem-per-cpu logic for core or socket allocations with multiple
    threads per core.
 -- Fix for older < glibc 2.4 systems to use euidaccess() instead of eaccess().
 -- BLUEGENE - Do not alter a pending job's node count when changing it's
    partition.
 -- BGQ - Add functionality to make it so we track the actions on a block.
    This is needed for when a free request is added to a block but there are
    jobs finishing up so we don't start new jobs on the block since they will
    fail on start.
 -- BGQ - Fixed InactiveLimit to work correctly to avoid scenarios where a
    user's pending allocation was started with srun and then for some reason
    the slurmctld was brought down and while it was down the srun was removed.
 -- Fixed InactiveLimit math to work correctly
 -- BGQ - Add logic to make it so blocks can't use a midplane with a nodeboard
    in error for passthrough.
 -- BGQ - Make it so if a nodeboard goes in error any block using that midplane
    for passthrough gets removed on a dynamic system.
 -- BGQ - Fix for printing realtime server debug correctly.
 -- BGQ - Cleaner handling of cnode failures when reported through the runjob
    interface instead of through the normal method.
 -- smap - spread node information across multiple lines for larger systems.
 -- Cray - Defer salloc until after PrologSlurmctld completes.
 -- Correction to slurmdbd communications failure handling logic, incorrect
    error codes returned in some cases.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.3
========================
 -- Accounting - Fix so complete 32 bit numbers can be put in for a priority.
 -- cgroups - fix if initial directory is non-existent SLURM creates it
    correctly.  Before the errno wasn't being checked correctly
 -- BGQ - fixed srun when only requesting a task count and not a node count
    to operate the same way salloc or sbatch did and assign a task per cpu
    by default instead of task per node.
 -- Fix salloc --gid to work correctly.  Reported by Brian Gilmer
 -- BGQ - fix smap to set the correct default MloaderImage
 -- BLUEGENE - updated documentation.
 -- Close the batch job's environment file when it contains no data to avoid
    leaking file descriptors.
 -- Fix sbcast's credential to last till the end of a job instead of the
    previous 20 minute time limit.  The previous behavior would fail for
    large files 20 minutes into the transfer.
 -- Return ESLURM_NODES_BUSY rather than ESLURM_NODE_NOT_AVAIL error on job
    submit when required nodes are up, but completing a job or in exclusive
    job allocation.
 -- Add HWLOC_FLAGS so linking to libslurm works correctly
 -- BGQ - If using backfill and a shared block is running at least one job
    and a job comes through backfill and can fit on the block without ending
    jobs don't set an end_time for the running jobs since they don't need to
    end to start the job.
 -- Initialize bind_verbose when using task/cgroup.
 -- BGQ - Fix for handling backfill much better when sharing blocks.
 -- BGQ - Fix for making small blocks on first pass if not sharing blocks.
 -- BLUEGENE - Remove force of default conn_type instead of leaving NAV
    when none are requested.  The Block allocator sets it up temporarily so
    this isn't needed.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix deadlock issue when dealing with bad hardware if using
    static blocks.
 -- Fix to mysql plugin during rollup to only query suspended table when jobs
    reported some suspended time.
 -- Fix compile with glibc 2.16 (Kacper Kowalik)
 -- BGQ - fix for deadlock where a block has error on it and all jobs
    running on it are preemptable by scheduling job.
 -- proctrack/cgroup: Exclude internal threads from "scontrol list pids".
    Patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.

    start in the future but is able to run now.
 -- CRAY - update to work with ALPS 5.1
 -- BGQ - Handle issue of speed and mutexes when polling instead of using the
    realtime server.
 -- BGQ - Fix minor sorting issue with sview when sorting by midplanes.
 -- Accounting - Fix for handling per user max node/cpus limits on a QOS
    correctly for current job.
 -- Update documentation for -/+= when updating a reservation's
    users/accounts/flags
 -- Update pam module to work if using aliases on nodes instead of actual
    host names.
 -- Correction to task layout logic in select/cons_res for job with minimum
    and maximum node count.
 -- BGQ - Put final poll after realtime comes back into service to avoid
    having the realtime server go down over and over again while waiting
    for the poll to finish.
 -- task/cgroup/memory - ensure that ConstrainSwapSpace=no is correctly
    handled. Work by Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- CRAY - Fix for sacct -N option to work correctly
 -- CRAY - Update documentation to describe installation from rpm instead
    or previous piecemeal method.
 -- Fix sacct to work with QOS' that have previously been deleted.
 -- Added all available limits to the output of sacctmgr list qos

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.2
========================
 -- BLUEGENE - Correct potential deadlock issue when hardware goes bad and
    there are jobs running on that hardware.
 -- If job is submitted to more than one partition, it's partition pointer can
    be set to an invalid value. This can result in the count of CPUs allocated
    on a node being bad, resulting in over- or under-allocation of its CPUs.
    Patch by Carles Fenoy, BSC.
 -- Fix bug in task layout with select/cons_res plugin and --ntasks-per-node
    option. Patch by Martin Perry, Bull.
 -- BLUEGENE - remove race condition where if a block is removed while waiting
    for a job to finish on it the number of unused cpus wasn't updated
    correctly.
 -- BGQ - make sure we have a valid block when creating or finishing a step
    allocation.
 -- BLUEGENE - If a large block (> 1 midplane) is in error and underlying
    hardware is marked bad remove the larger block and create a block over
    just the bad hardware making the other hardware available to run on.
 -- BLUEGENE - Handle job completion correctly if an admin removes a block
    where other blocks on an overlapping midplane are running jobs.
 -- BLUEGENE - correctly remove running jobs when freeing a block.
 -- BGQ - correct logic to place multiple (< 1 midplane) steps inside a
    multi midplane block allocation.
 -- BGQ - Make it possible for a multi midplane allocation to run on more
    than 1 midplane but not the entire allocation.
 -- BGL - Fix for syncing users on block from Tim Wickberg
 -- Fix initialization of protocol_version for some messages to make sure it
    is always set when sending or receiving a message.
 -- Reset backfilled job counter only when explicitly cleared using scontrol.
    Patch from Alejandro Lucero Palau, BSC.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for handling blocks when a larger block will not free and
    while it is attempting to free underlying hardware is marked in error
    making small blocks overlapping with the freeing block.  This only
    applies to dynamic layout mode.
 -- Cray and BlueGene - Do not treat lack of usable front-end nodes when
    slurmctld deamon starts as a fatal error. Also preserve correct front-end
    node for jobs when there is more than one front-end node and the slurmctld
    daemon restarts.
 -- Correct parsing of srun/sbatch input/output/error file names so that only
    the name "none" is mapped to /dev/null and not any file name starting
    with "none" (e.g. "none.o").
 -- BGQ - added version string to the load of the runjob_mux plugin to verify
    the current plugin has been loaded when using runjob_mux_refresh_config
 -- CGROUPS - Use system mount/umount function calls instead of doing fork
    exec of mount/umount from Janne Blomqvist.
 -- BLUEGENE - correct start time setup when no jobs are blocking the way
    from Mark Nelson
 -- Fixed sacct --state=S query to return information about suspended jobs
    current or in the past.
 -- FRONTEND - Made error warning more apparent if a frontend node isn't
    configured correctly.
 -- BGQ - update documentation about runjob_mux_refresh_config which works
    correctly as of IBM driver V1R1M1 efix 008.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.1
========================
 -- Fix bug for job state change from 2.3 -> 2.4 job state can now be preserved
    correctly when transitioning.  This also applies for 2.4.0 -> 2.4.1, no
    state will be lost. (Thanks to Carles Fenoy)

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.0
========================
 -- Cray - Improve support for zero compute note resource allocations.
    Partition used can now be configured with no nodes nodes.
 -- BGQ - make it so srun -i<taskid> works correctly.
 -- Fix parse_uint32/16 to complain if a non-digit is given.
 -- Add SUBMITHOST to job state passed to Moab vial sched/wiki2. Patch by Jon
    Bringhurst (LANL).
 -- BGQ - Fix issue when running with AllowSubBlockAllocations=Yes without
    compiling with --enable-debug
 -- Modify scontrol to require "-dd" option to report batch job's script. Patch
    from Don Albert, Bull.

    changed to "bf_resolution=". Patch from Rod Schultz, Bull.
 -- Fix bug that clears job pending reason field. Patch fron Don Lipari, LLNL.
 -- In etc/init.d/slurm move check for scontrol after sourcing
    /etc/sysconfig/slurm. Patch from Andy Wettstein, University of Chicago.
 -- Fix in scheduling logic that can delay jobs with min/max node counts.
 -- BGQ - fix issue where if a step uses the entire allocation and then
    the next step in the allocation only uses part of the allocation it gets
    the correct cnodes.
 -- BGQ - Fix checking for IO on a block with new IBM driver V1R1M1 previous
    function didn't always work correctly.
 -- BGQ - Fix issue when a nodeboard goes down and you want to combine blocks
    to make a larger small block and are running with sub-blocks.
 -- BLUEGENE - Better logic for making small blocks around bad nodeboard/card.
 -- BGQ - When using an old IBM driver cnodes that go into error because of
    a job kill timeout aren't always reported to the system.  This is now
    handled by the runjob_mux plugin.
 -- BGQ - Added information on how to setup the runjob_mux to run as SlurmUser.
 -- Improve memory consumption on step layouts with high task count.
 -- BGQ - quiter debug when the real time server comes back but there are
    still messages we find when we poll but haven't given it back to the real
    time yet.
 -- BGQ - fix for if a request comes in smaller than the smallest block and
    we must use a small block instead of a shared midplane block.
 -- Fix issues on large jobs (>64k tasks) to have the correct counter type when
    packing the step layout structure.
 -- BGQ - fix issue where if a user was asking for tasks and ntasks-per-node
    but not node count the node count is correctly figured out.
 -- Move logic to always use the 1st alphanumeric node as the batch host for
    batch jobs.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix race condition where if a nodeboard/card goes down at the
    same time a block is destroyed and that block just happens to be the
    smallest overlapping block over the bad hardware.
 -- Fix bug when querying accounting looking for a job node size.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix possible race condition if cleaning up a block and the
    removal of the job on the block failed.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix issue if a cable was in an error state make it so we can
    check if a block is still makable if the cable wasn't in error.
 -- Put nodes names in alphabetic order in node table.
 -- If preempted job should have a grace time and preempt mode is not cancel
    but job is going to be canceled because it is interactive or other reason
    it now receives the grace time.
 -- BGQ - Modified documents to explain new plugin_flags needed in bg.properties
    in order for the runjob_mux to run correctly.
 -- BGQ - change linking from libslurm.o to libslurmhelper.la to avoid warning.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.0.rc1
=============================
 -- Improve task binding logic by making fuller use of HWLOC library,
    especially with respect to Opteron 6000 series processors. Work contributed
    by Komoto Masahiro.
 -- Add new configuration parameter PriorityFlags, based upon work by
    Carles Fenoy (Barcelona Supercomputer Center).
 -- Modify the step completion RPC between slurmd and slurmstepd in order to
    eliminate a possible deadlock. Based on work by Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Change the owner of slurmctld and slurmdbd log files to the appropriate
    user. Without this change the files will be created by and owned by the
    user starting the daemons (likely user root).
 -- Reorganize the slurmstepd logic in order to better support NFS and
    Kerberos credentials via the AUKS plugin. Work by Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Fix bug in allocating GRES that are associated with specific CPUs. In some
    cases the code allocated first available GRES to job instead of allocating
    GRES accessible to the specific CPUs allocated to the job.
 -- spank: Add callbacks in slurmd: slurm_spank_slurmd_{init,exit}
    and job epilog/prolog: slurm_spank_job_{prolog,epilog}
 -- spank: Add spank_option_getopt() function to api
 -- Change resolution of switch wait time from minutes to seconds.
 -- Added CrpCPUMins to the output of sshare -l for those using hard limit
    accounting.  Work contributed by Mark Nelson.
 -- Added mpi/pmi2 plugin for complete support of pmi2 including acquiring
    additional resources for newly launched tasks. Contributed by Hongjia Cao,
    NUDT.
 -- BGQ - fixed issue where if a user asked for a specific node count and more
    tasks than possible without overcommit the request would be allowed on more
    nodes than requested.
 -- Add support for new SchedulerParameters of bf_max_job_user, maximum number
    of jobs to attempt backfilling per user. Work by Bjørn-Helge Mevik,
    University of Oslo.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed issue where MaxNodes limit on a partition only limited
    larger than midplane jobs.
 -- Added cpu_run_min to the output of sshare --long.  Work contributed by
    Mark Nelson.
 -- BGQ - allow regular users to resolve Rack-Midplane to AXYZ coords.
 -- Add sinfo output format option of "%R" for partition name without "*"
    appended for default partition.
 -- Cray - Add support for zero compute note resource allocation to run batch
    script on front-end node with no ALPS reservation. Useful for pre- or post-
    processing.
 -- Support for cyclic distribution of cpus in task/cgroup plugin from Martin
    Perry, Bull.
 -- GrpMEM limit for QOSes and associations added Patch from Bjørn-Helge Mevik,
    University of Oslo.
 -- Various performance improvements for up to 500% higher throughput depending
    upon configuration. Work supported by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
    Extreme Scale Systems Center.
 -- Added jobacct_gather/cgroup plugin.  It is not advised to use this in
    production as it isn't currently complete and doesn't provide an equivalent
    substitution for jobacct_gather/linux yet. Work by Martin Perry, Bull.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.0.pre4
=============================
 -- Add logic to cache GPU file information (bitmap index mapping to device
    file number) in the slurmd daemon and transfer that information to the
    slurmstepd whenever a job step is initiated. This is needed to set the
    appropriate CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable value when the
    devices are not in strict numeric order (e.g. some GPUs are skipped).
    Based upon work by Nicolas Bigaouette.
 -- BGQ - Remove ability to make a sub-block with a geometry with one or more
    of it's dimensions of length 3.  There is a limitation in the IBM I/O
    subsystem that is problematic with multiple sub-blocks with a dimension
    of length 3, so we will disallow them to be able to be created.  This
    mean you if you ask the system for an allocation of 12 c-nodes you will
    be given 16.  If this is ever fix in BGQ you can remove this patch.
 -- BLUEGENE - Better handling blocks that go into error state or deallocate
    while jobs are running on them.
 -- BGQ - fix for handling mix of steps running at same time some of which
    are full allocation jobs, and others that are smaller.
 -- BGQ - fix for core dump after running multiple sub-block jobs on static
    blocks.
 -- BGQ - fixed sync issue where if a job finishes in SLURM but not in mmcs
    for a long time after the SLURM job has been flushed from the system
    we don't have to worry about rebooting the block to sync the system.
 -- BGQ - In scontrol/sview node counts are now displayed with
    CnodeCount/CnodeErrCount so to point out there are cnodes in an error state
    on the block.  Draining the block and having it reboot when all jobs are
    gone will clear up the cnodes in Software Failure.
 -- Change default SchedulerParameters max_switch_wait field value from 60 to
    300 seconds.
 -- BGQ - catch errors from the kill option of the runjob client.
 -- BLUEGENE - make it so the epilog runs until slurmctld tells it the job is
    gone.  Previously it had a timelimit which has proven to not be the right
    thing.
 -- FRONTEND - fix issue where if a compute node was in a down state and
    an admin updates the node to idle/resume the compute nodes will go
    instantly to idle instead of idle* which means no response.
 -- Fix regression in 2.4.0.pre3 where number of submitted jobs limit wasn't
    being honored for QOS.
 -- Cray - Enable logging of BASIL communications with environment variables.
    Set XML_LOG to enable logging. Set XML_LOG_LOC to specify path to log file
    or "SLURM" to write to SlurmctldLogFile or unset for "slurm_basil_xml.log".
    Patch from Steve Tronfinoff, CSCS.
 -- FRONTEND - if a front end unexpectedly reboots kill all jobs but don't
    mark front end node down.
 -- FRONTEND - don't down a front end node if you have an epilog error
 -- BLUEGENE - if a job has an epilog error don't down the midplane it was
    running on.
 -- BGQ - added new DebugFlag (NoRealTime) for only printing debug from
    state change while the realtime server is running.
 -- Fix multi-cluster mode with sview starting on a non-bluegene cluster going
    to a bluegene cluster.
 -- BLUEGENE - ability to show Rack Midplane name of midplanes in sview and
    scontrol.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.0.pre3
=============================
 -- Let a job be submitted even if it exceeds a QOS limit. Job will be left
    in a pending state until the QOS limit or job parameters change. Patch by
    Phil Eckert, LLNL.
 -- Add sacct support for the option "--name". Work by Yuri D'Elia, Center for
    Biomedicine, EURAC Research, Italy.
 -- BGQ - handle preemption.
 -- Add an srun shepard process to cancel a job and/or step of the srun process
    is killed abnormally (e.g. SIGKILL).
 -- BGQ - handle deadlock issue when a nodeboard goes into an error state.
 -- BGQ - more thorough handling of blocks with multiple jobs running on them.
 -- Fix man2html process to compile in the build directory instead of the
    source dir.
 -- Behavior of srun --multi-prog modified so that any program arguments
    specified on the command line will be appended to the program arguments
    specified in the program configuration file.
 -- Add new command, sdiag, which reports a variety of job scheduling
    statistics. Based upon work by Alejandro Lucero Palau, BSC.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added DefaultConnType to the bluegene.conf file.  This makes it
    so you can specify any connection type you would like (TORUS or MESH) as
    the default in dynamic mode.  Previously it always defaulted to TORUS.
 -- Made squeue -n and -w options more consistent with salloc, sbatch, srun,
    and scancel. Patch by Don Lipari, LLNL.
 -- Have sacctmgr remove user records when no associations exist for that user.
 -- Several header file changes for clean build with NetBSD. Patches from
    Aleksej Saushev.
 -- Fix for possible deadlock in accounting logic: Avoid calling
    jobacct_gather_g_getinfo() until there is data to read from the socket.
 -- Fix race condition that could generate "job_cnt_comp underflow" errors on
    front-end architectures.
 -- BGQ - Fix issue where a system with missing cables could cause core dump.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.0.pre2
=============================
 -- CRAY - Add support for GPU memory allocation using SLURM GRES (Generic
    RESource) support. Work by Steve Trofinoff, CSCS.
 -- Add support for job allocations with multiple job constraint counts. For
    example: salloc -C "[rack1*2&rack2*4]" ... will allocate the job 2 nodes
    from rack1 and 4 nodes from rack2. Support for only a single constraint
    name been added to job step support.
 -- BGQ - Remove old method for marking cnodes down.
 -- BGQ - Remove BGP images from view in sview.
 -- BGQ - print out failed cnodes in scontrol show nodes.
 -- BGQ - Add srun option of "--runjob-opts" to pass options to the runjob
    command.
 -- FRONTEND - handle step launch failure better.
 -- BGQ - Added a mutex to protect the now changing ba_system pointers.
 -- BGQ - added new functionality for sub-block allocations - no preemption
    for this yet though.
 -- Add --name option to squeue to filter output by job name. Patch from Yuri
    D'Elia.
 -- BGQ - Added linking to runjob client libary which gives support to totalview
    to use srun instead of runjob.
 -- Add numeric range checks to scontrol update options. Patch from Phil
    Eckert, LLNL.
 -- Add ReconfigFlags configuration option to control actions of "scontrol
    reconfig". Patch from Don Albert, Bull.
 -- BGQ - handle reboots with multiple jobs running on a block.
 -- BGQ - Add message handler thread to forward signals to runjob process.

* Changes in SLURM 2.4.0.pre1
=============================
 -- BGQ - use the ba_geo_tables to figure out the blocks instead of the old
    algorithm.  The improves timing in the worst cases and simplifies the code
    greatly.
 -- BLUEGENE - Change to output tools labels from BP to Midplane
    (i.e. BP List -> MidplaneList).
 -- BLUEGENE - read MPs and BPs from the bluegene.conf
 -- Modify srun's SIGINT handling logic timer (two SIGINTs within one second) to
    be based microsecond rather than second timer.
 -- Modify advance reservation to accept multiple specific block sizes rather
    than a single node count.
 -- Permit administrator to change a job's QOS to any value without validating
    the job's owner has permission to use that QOS. Based upon patch by Phil
    Eckert (LLNL).
 -- Add trigger flag for a permanent trigger. The trigger will NOT be purged
    after an event occurs, but only when explicitly deleted.
 -- Interpret a reservation with Nodes=ALL and a Partition specification as
    reserving all nodes within the specified partition rather than all nodes
    on the system. Based upon patch by Phil Eckert (LLNL).
 -- Add the ability to reboot all compute nodes after they become idle. The
    RebootProgram configuration parameter must be set and an authorized user
    must execute the command "scontrol reboot_nodes". Patch from Andriy
    Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- Modify slurmdbd.conf parsing to accept DebugLevel strings (quiet, fatal,
    info, etc.) in addition to numeric values. The parsing of slurm.conf was
    modified in the same fashion for SlurmctldDebug and SlurmdDebug values.
    The output of sview and "scontrol show config" was also modified to report
    those values as strings rather than numeric values.
 -- Changed default value of StateSaveLocation configuration parameter from
    /tmp to /var/spool.
 -- Prevent associations from being deleted if it has any jobs in running,
    pending or suspended state. Previous code prevented this only for running
    jobs.
 -- If a job can not run due to QOS or association limits, then do not cancel
    the job, but leave it pending in a system held state (priority = 1). The
    job will run when its limits or the QOS/association limits change. Based
    upon a patch by Phil Ekcert (LLNL).
 -- BGQ - Added logic to keep track of cnodes in an error state inside of a
    booted block.
 -- Added the ability to update a node's NodeAddr and NodeHostName with
    scontrol. Also enable setting a node's state to "future" using scontrol.

    a sub midplane system.
 -- Added the UserID of the user issuing the RPC to the job_submit/lua
    functions.
 -- Fixed issue where if a job ended with ESLURMD_UID_NOT_FOUND and
    ESLURMD_GID_NOT_FOUND where slurm would be a little over zealous
    in treating missing a GID or UID as a fatal error.

    isn't up at the time the slurmctld starts, not running the
    priority/multifactor plugin, and then the database is started up later.
 -- Gres: If a gres has a count of one and an associated file then when doing
    a reconfiguration, the node's bitmap was not cleared resulting in an
    underflow upon job termination or removal from scheduling matrix by the
    backfill scheduler.
 -- Fix race condition in job dependency logic which can result in invalid
    memory reference.

    range count in job allocation request.
 -- Fixed moab_2_slurmdb.pl script to correctly work for end records.

    10 jobs.
 -- Fix potential race condition if MinJobAge is very low (i.e. 1) and using
    slurmdbd accounting and running large amounts of jobs (>50 sec).  Job
    information could be corrupted before it had a chance to reach the DBD.
 -- Fix state restore of job limit set from admin value for min_cpus.
 -- Fix clearing of limit values if an admin removes the limit for max cpus
    and time limit where it was previously set by an admin.
 -- Fix issue where log message is more than 256 chars and then has a format.

    Saushev.
 -- Fix smap regression to display nodes that are drained or down correctly.
 -- Several bug fixes and performance improvements with related to batch
    scripts containing very large numbers of arguments. Patches from Par
    Andersson, NSC.
 -- Fixed extremely hard to reproduce threading issue in assoc_mgr.
 -- Correct "scontrol show daemons" output if there is more than one
    ControlMachine configured.
 -- Add node read lock where needed in slurmctld/agent code.
 -- Added test for LUA library named "liblua5.1.so.0" in addition to

    NOT remove the ALPS limitation that only one job reservation can be created
    for each Linux session ID.
 -- Cray - For srun wrapper when creating a job allocation, set the default job
    name to the executable file's name.
 -- Add support for Cray ALPS 5.0.0

 -- Fix for possible invalid memory reference in slurmctld in job dependency
    logic. Patch from Carles Fenoy (Barcelona Supercomputer Center).

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.2
========================
 -- Add configure option of "--without-rpath" which builds SLURM tools without
    the rpath option, which will work if Munge and BlueGene libraries are in
    the default library search path and make system updates easier.
 -- Fixed issue where if a job ended with ESLURMD_UID_NOT_FOUND and
    ESLURMD_GID_NOT_FOUND where slurm would be a little over zealous
    in treating missing a GID or UID as a fatal error.
 -- Backfill scheduling - Add SchedulerParameters configuration parameter of
    "bf_res" to control the resolution in the backfill scheduler's data about
    when jobs begin and end. Default value is 60 seconds (used to be 1 second).

 -- Updated set_oomadj.c, replacing deprecated oom_adj reference with
    oom_score_adj
 -- Fix resource allocation bug, generic resources allocation was ignoring the

    wasn't started at the time the eligible message was sent but started
    before the db_index was returned information like start time would be lost.
 -- Fix issue in accounting where normalized shares could be updated
    incorrectly when getting fairshare from the parent.
 -- Fixed if not enforcing associations  but want QOS support for a default
    qos on the cluster to fill that in correctly.
 -- Fix in select/cons_res for "fatal: cons_res: sync loop not progressing"
    with some configurations and job option combinations.
 -- BLUEGNE - Fixed issue with handling HTC modes and rebooting.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.1
========================
 -- Do not remove the backup slurmctld's pid file when it assumes control, only
    when it actually shuts down. Patch from Andriy Grytsenko (Massive Solutions
    Limited).

    is in an error state, won't deny jobs.
 -- Fix for accounting where your cluster isn't numbered in counting order
    (i.e. 1-9,0 instead of 0-9).  The bug would cause 'sacct -N nodename' to
    not give correct results on these systems.
 -- Fix to GRES allocation logic when resources are associated with specific
    CPUs on a node. Patch from Steve Trofinoff, CSCS.
 -- Fix bugs in sched/backfill with respect to QOS reservation support and job
    time limits. Patch from Alejandro Lucero Palau (Barcelona Supercomputer

 -- Major updates to cgroup support by Mark Grondona (LLNL) and Matthieu
    Hautreux (CEA) and Sam Lang. Fixes timing problems with respect to the
    task_epilog. Allows cgroup mount point to be configurable. Added new

==========================
 -- Fix for memory issue inside sview.
 -- Fix issue where if a job was pending and the slurmctld was restarted a
    variable wasn't initialized in the job structure making it so that job
    wouldn't run.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0
========================
 -- BLUEGENE - make sure we only set the jobinfo_select start_loc on a job
    when we are on a small block, not a regular one.
 -- BGQ - fix issue where not copying the correct amount of memory.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix clean start if jobs were running when the slurmctld was
    shutdown and then the system size changed.  This would probably only happen
    if you were emulating a system.
 -- Fix sview for calling a cray system from a non-cray system to get the
    correct geometry of the system.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix to correctly import pervious version of block state file.
 -- BLUEGENE - handle loading better when doing a clean start with static
    blocks.
 -- Add sinfo format and sort option "%n" for NodeHostName and "%o" for
    NodeAddr.
 -- If a job is deferred due to partition limits, then re-test those limits
    after a partition is modified. Patch from Don Lipari.
 -- Fix bug which would crash slurmcld if job's owner (not root) tries to clear
    a job's licenses by setting value to "".
 -- Cosmetic fix for printing out debug info in the priority plugin.
 -- In sview when switching from a bluegene machine to a regular linux cluster
    and vice versa the node->base partition lists will be displayed if setup
    in your .slurm/sviewrc file.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for creating full system static block on a BGQ system.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix deadlock issue if toggling between Dynamic and Static block
    allocation with jobs running on blocks that don't exist in the static
    setup.
 -- BLUEGENE - Modify code to only give HTC states to BGP systems and not
    allow them on Q systems.
 -- BLUEGENE - Make it possible for an admin to define multiple dimension
    conn_types in a block definition.
 -- BGQ - Alter tools to output multiple dimensional conn_type.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.rc2
============================
 -- With sched/wiki or sched/wiki2 (Maui or Moab scheduler), insure that a
    requeued job's priority is reset to zero.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix to run steps correctly in a BGL/P emulated system.
 -- Fixed issue where if there was a network issue between the slurmctld and
    the DBD where both remained up but were disconnected the slurmctld would
    get registered again with the DBD.
 -- Fixed issue where if the DBD connection from the ctld goes away because of
    a POLLERR the dbd_fail callback is called.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix to smap command-line mode display.
 -- Change in GRES behavior for job steps: A job step's default generic
    resource allocation will be set to that of the job. If a job step's --gres
    value is set to "none" then none of the generic resources which have been
    allocated to the job will be allocated to the job step.
 -- Add srun environment value of SLURM_STEP_GRES to set default --gres value
    for a job step.
 -- Require SchedulerTimeSlice configuration parameter to be at least 5 seconds
    to avoid thrashing slurmd daemon.
 -- Cray - Fix to make nodes state in accounting consistent with state set by
    ALPS.
 -- Cray - A node DOWN to ALPS will be marked DOWN to SLURM only after reaching
    SlurmdTimeout. In the interim, the node state will be NO_RESPOND. This
    change makes behavior makes SLURM handling of the node DOWN state more
    consistent with ALPS. This change effects only Cray systems.
 -- Cray - Fix to work with 4.0.* instead of just 4.0.0
 -- Cray - Modify srun/aprun wrapper to map --exclusive to -F exclusive and
    --share to -F share. Note this does not consider the partition's Shared
    configuration, so it is an imperfect mapping of options.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added notice in the print config to tell if you are emulated
    or not.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix job step scalability issue with large task count.
 -- BGQ - Improved c-node selection when asked for a sub-block job that
    cannot fit into the available shape.
 -- BLUEGENE - Modify "scontrol show step" to show  I/O nodes (BGL and BGP) or
    c-nodes (BGQ) allocated to each step. Change field name from "Nodes=" to
    "BP_List=".
 -- Code cleanup on step request to get the correct select_jobinfo.
 -- Memory leak fixed for rolling up accounting with down clusters.
 -- BGQ - fix issue where if first job step is the entire block and then the
    next parallel step is ran on a sub block, SLURM won't over subscribe cnodes.
 -- Treat duplicate switch name in topology.conf as fatal error. Patch from Rod
    Schultz, Bull
 -- Minor update to documentation describing the AllowGroups option for a
    partition in the slurm.conf.
 -- Fix problem with _job_create() when not using qos's.  It makes
    _job_create() consistent with similar logic in select_nodes().
 -- GrpCPURunMins in a QOS flushed out.
 -- Fix for squeue -t "CONFIGURING" to actually work.
 -- CRAY - Add cray.conf parameter of SyncTimeout, maximum time to defer job
    scheduling if SLURM node or job state are out of synchronization with ALPS.
 -- If salloc was run as interactive, with job control, reset the foreground
    process group of the terminal to the process group of the parent pid before
    exiting. Patch from Don Albert, Bull.
 -- BGQ - set up the corner of a sub block correctly based on a relative
    position in the block instead of absolute.
 -- BGQ - make sure the recently added select_jobinfo of a step launch request
    isn't sent to the slurmd where environment variables would be overwritten
    incorrectly.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.rc1
============================
 -- NOTE THERE HAVE BEEN NEW FIELDS ADDED TO THE JOB AND PARTITION STATE SAVE
    FILES AND RPCS. PENDING AND RUNNING JOBS WILL BE LOST WHEN UPGRADING FROM
    EARLIER VERSION 2.3 PRE-RELEASES AND RPCS WILL NOT WORK WITH EARLIER
    VERSIONS.
 -- select/cray: Add support for Accelerator information including model and
    memory options.
 -- Cray systems: Add support to suspend/resume salloc command to insure that
    aprun does not get initiated when the job is suspended. Processes suspended
    and resumed are determined by using process group ID and parent process ID,
    so some processes may be missed. Since salloc runs as a normal user, it's
    ability to identify processes associated with a job is limited.
 -- Cray systems: Modify smap and sview to display all nodes even if multiple
    nodes exist at each coordinate.
 -- Improve efficiency of select/linear plugin with topology/tree plugin
    configured, Patch by Andriy Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- For front-end architectures on which job steps are run (emulated Cray and
    BlueGene systems only), fix bug that would free memory still in use.
 -- Add squeue support to display a job's license information. Patch by Andy
    Roosen (University of Deleware).
 -- Add flag to the select APIs for job suspend/resume indicating if the action
    is for gang scheduling or an explicit job suspend/resume by the user. Only
    an explicit job suspend/resume will reset the job's priority and make
    resources exclusively held by the job available to other jobs.
 -- Fix possible invalid memory reference in sched/backfill. Patch by Andriy
    Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- Add select_jobinfo to the task launch RPC. Based upon patch by Andriy
    Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- Add DefMemPerCPU/Node and MaxMemPerCPU/Node to partition configuration.
    This improves flexibility when gang scheduling only specific partitions.
 -- Added new enums to print out when a job is held by a QOS instead of an
    association limit.
 -- Enhancements to sched/backfill performance with select/cons_res plugin.
    Patch from Bjørn-Helge Mevik, University of Oslo.
 -- Correct job run time reported by smap for suspended jobs.
 -- Improve job preemption logic to avoid preempting more jobs than needed.
 -- Add contribs/arrayrun tool providing support for job arrays. Contributed by
    Bjørn-Helge Mevik, University of Oslo. NOTE: Not currently packaged as RPM
    and manual file editing is required.
 -- When suspending a job, wait 2 seconds instead of 1 second between sending
    SIGTSTP and SIGSTOP. Some MPI implementation were not stopping within the
    1 second delay.
 -- Add support for managing devices based upon Linux cgroup container. Based
    upon patch by Yiannis Georgiou, Bull.
 -- Fix memory buffering bug if a AllowGroups parameter of a partition has 100
    or more users. Patch by Andriy Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- Fix bug in generic resource tracking of gres associated with specific CPUs.
    Resources were being over-allocated.
 -- On systems with front-end nodes (IBM BlueGene and Cray) limit batch jobs to
    only one CPU of these shared resources.
 -- Set SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU or SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE environment variables for both
    interactive (salloc) and batch jobs if the job has a memory limit. For Cray
    systems also set CRAY_AUTO_APRUN_OPTIONS environment variable with the
    memory limit.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res task distribution logic when tasks-per-node=0.
    Patch from Rod Schultz, Bull.
 -- Restore node configuration information (CPUs, memory, etc.) for powered
    down when slurmctld daemon restarts rather than waiting for the node to be
    restored to service and getting the information from the node (NOTE: Only
    relevent if FastSchedule=0).
 -- For Cray systems with the srun2aprun wrapper, rebuild the srun man page
    identifying the srun optioins which are valid on that system.
 -- BlueGene: Permit users to specify a separate connection type for each
    dimension (e.g. "--conn-type=torus,mesh,torus").
 -- Add the ability for a user to limit the number of leaf switches in a job's
    allocation using the --switch option of salloc, sbatch and srun. There is
    also a new SchedulerParameters value of max_switch_wait, which a SLURM
    administrator can used to set a maximum job delay and prevent a user job
    from blocking lower priority jobs for too long. Based on work by Rod
    Schultz, Bull.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.pre6
=============================
 -- NOTE: THERE HAS BEEN A NEW FIELD ADDED TO THE CONFIGURATION RESPONSE RPC
    AS SHOWN BY "SCONTROL SHOW CONFIG". THIS FUNCTION WILL ONLY WORK WHEN THE
    SERVER AND CLIENT ARE BOTH RUNNING SLURM VERSION 2.3.0.pre6
 -- Modify job expansion logic to support licenses, generic resources, and
    currently running job steps.
 -- Added an rpath if using the --with-munge option of configure.
 -- Add support for multiple sets of DEFAULT node, partition, and frontend
    specifications in slurm.conf so that default values can be changed mulitple
    times as the configuration file is read.
 -- BLUEGENE - Improved logic to place small blocks in free space before freeing
    larger blocks.
 -- Add optional argument to srun's --kill-on-bad-exit so that user can set
    its value to zero and override a SLURM configuration parameter of
    KillOnBadExit.
 -- Fix bug in GraceTime support for preempted jobs that prevented proper
    operation when more than one job was being preempted. Based on patch from
    Bill Brophy, Bull.
 -- Fix for running sview from a non-bluegene cluster to a bluegene cluster.
    Regression from pre5.
 -- If job's TMPDIR environment is not set or is not usable, reset to "/tmp".
    Patch from Andriy Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- Remove logic for defunct RPC: DBD_GET_JOBS.
 -- Propagate DebugFlag changes by scontrol to the plugins.
 -- Improve accuracy of REQUEST_JOB_WILL_RUN start time with respect to higher
    priority pending jobs.
 -- Add -R/--reservation option to squeue command as a job filter.
 -- Add scancel support for --clusters option.
 -- Note that scontrol and sprio can only support a single cluster at one time.
 -- Add support to salloc for a new environment variable SALLOC_KILL_CMD.
 -- Add scontrol ability to increment or decrement a job or step time limit.
 -- Add support for SLURM_TIME_FORMAT environment variable to control time
    stamp output format. Work by Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Fix error handling in mvapich plugin that could cause srun to enter an
    infinite loop under rare circumstances.
 -- Add support for multiple task plugins. Patch from Andriy Grytsenko (Massive
    Solutions Limited).
 -- Addition of per-user node/cpu limits for QOS's. Patch from Aaron Knister,
    UMBC.
 -- Fix logic for multiple job resize operations.
 -- BLUEGENE - many fixes to make things work correctly on a L/P system.
 -- Fix bug in layout of job step with --nodelist option plus node count. Old
    code could allocate too few nodes.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.pre5
=============================
 -- NOTE: THERE HAS BEEN A NEW FIELD ADDED TO THE JOB STATE FILE. UPGRADES FROM
    VERSION 2.3.0-PRE4 WILL RESULT IN LOST JOBS UNLESS THE "orig_dependency"
    FIELD IS REMOVED FROM JOB STATE SAVE/RESTORE LOGIC. ON CRAY SYSTEMS A NEW
    "confirm_cookie" FIELD WAS ADDED AND HAS THE SAME EFFECT OF DISABLING JOB
    STATE RESTORE.
 -- BLUEGENE - Improve speed of start up when removing blocks at the beginning.
 -- Correct init.d/slurm status to have non-zero exit code if ANY Slurm
    damon that should be running on the node is not running. Patch from Rod
    Schulz, Bull.
 -- Improve accuracy of response to "srun --test-only jobid=#".
 -- Fix bug in front-end configurations which reports job_cnt_comp underflow
    errors after slurmctld restarts.
 -- Eliminate "error from _trigger_slurmctld_event in backup.c" due to lack of
    event triggers.
 -- Fix logic in BackupController to properly recover front-end node state and
    avoid purging active jobs.
 -- Added man pages to html pages and the new cpu_management.html page.
    Submitted by Martin Perry / Rod Schultz, Bull.
 -- Job dependency information will only show the currently active dependencies
    rather than the original dependencies. From Dan Rusak, Bull.
 -- Add RPCs to get the SPANK environment variables from the slurmctld daemon.
    Patch from Andrej N. Gritsenko.
 -- Updated plugins/task/cgroup/task_cgroup_cpuset.c to support newer
    HWLOC_API_VERSION.
 -- Do not build select/bluegene plugin if C++ compiler is not installed.
 -- Add new configure option --with-srun2aprun to build an srun command
    which is a wrapper over Cray's aprun command and supports many srun
    options. Without this option, the srun command will advise the user
    to use the aprun command.
 -- Change container ID supported by proctrack plugin from 32-bit to 64-bit.
 -- Added contribs/cray/libalps_test_programs.tar.gz with tools to validate
    SLURM's logic used to support Cray systems.
 -- Create RPM for srun command that is a wrapper for the Cray/ALPS aprun
    command. Dependent upon .rpmmacros parameter of "%_with_srun2aprun".
 -- Add configuration parameter MaxStepCount to limit effect of bad batch
    scripts.
 -- Moving to github
 -- Fix for handling a 2.3 system talking to a 2.2 slurmctld.
 -- Add contribs/lua/job_submit.license.lua script. Update job_submit and Lua
    related documentation.
 -- Test if _make_batch_script() is called with a NULL script.
 -- Increase hostlist support from 24k to 64k nodes.
 -- Renamed the Accounting Storage database's "DerivedExitString" job field to
    "Comment".  Provided backward compatible support for "DerivedExitString" in
    the sacctmgr tool.
 -- Added the ability to save the job's comment field to the Accounting
    Storage db (to the formerly named, "DerivedExitString" job field).  This
    behavior is enabled by a new slurm.conf parameter:
    AccountingStoreJobComment.
 -- Test if _make_batch_script() is called with a NULL script.
 -- Increase hostlist support from 24k to 64k nodes.
 -- Fix srun to handle signals correctly when waiting for a step creation.
 -- Preserve the last job ID across slurmctld daemon restarts even if the job
    state file can not be fully recovered.
 -- Made the hostlist functions be able to arbitrarily handle any size
    dimension no matter what the size of the cluster is in dimensions.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.pre4
=============================
 -- Add GraceTime to Partition and QOS data structures. Preempted jobs will be
    given this time interval before termination. Work by Bill Brophy, Bull.
 -- Add the ability for scontrol and sview to modify slurmctld DebugFlags
    values.
 -- Various Cray-specific patches:
    - Fix a bug in distinguishing XT from XE.
    - Avoids problems with empty nodenames on Cray.
    - Check whether ALPS is hanging on to nodes, which happens if ALPS has not
      yet cleaned up the node partition.
    - Stops select/cray from clobbering node_ptr->reason.
    - Perform 'safe' release of ALPS reservations using inventory and apkill.
    - Compile-time sanity check for the apbasil and apkill files.
    - Changes error handling in do_basil_release() (called by
      select_g_job_fini()).
    - Warn that salloc --no-shell option is not supported on Cray systems.
 -- Add a reservation flag of "License_Only". If set, then jobs using the
    reservation may use the licenses associated with it plus any compute nodes.
    Otherwise the job is limited to the compute nodes associated with the
    reservation.
 -- Change slurm.conf node configuration parameter from "Procs" to "CPUs".
    Both parameters will be supported for now.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix for when user requests only midplane names with no count at
    job submission time to process the node count correctly.
 -- Fix job step resource allocation problem when both node and tasks counts
    are specified. New logic selects nodes with larger CPU counts as needed.
 -- BGQ - make it so srun wraps runjob (still under construction, but works
    for most cases)
 -- Permit a job's QOS and Comment field to both change in a single RPC. This
    was previously disabled since Moab stored the QOS within the Comment field.
 -- Add support for jobs to expand in size. Submit additional batch job with
    the option "--dependency=expand:<jobid>". See web page "faq.html#job_size"
    for details. Restrictions to be removed in the future.
 -- Added --with-alps-emulation to configure, and also an optional cray.conf
    to setup alps location and database information.
 -- Modify PMI data types from 16-bits to 32-bits in order to support MPICH2
    jobs with more than 65,536 tasks. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Set slurmd's soft process CPU limit equal to it's hard limit and notify the
    user if the limit is not infinite.
 -- Added proctrack/cgroup and task/cgroup plugins from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Fix slurmctld restart logic that could leave nodes in UNKNOWN state for a
    longer time than necessary after restart.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.pre3
=============================
 -- BGQ - Appears to work correctly in emulation mode, no sub blocks just yet.
 -- Minor typos fixed
 -- Various bug fixes for Cray systems.
 -- Fix bug that when setting a compute node to idle state, it was failing to
    set the systems up_node_bitmap.
 -- BLUEGENE - code reorder
 -- BLUEGENE - Now only one select plugin for all Bluegene systems.
 -- Modify srun to set the SLURM_JOB_NAME environment variable when srun is
    used to create a new job allocation. Not set when srun is used to create a
    job step within an existing job allocation.
 -- Modify init.d/slurm script to start multiple slurmd daemons per compute
    node if so configured. Patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Change license data structure counters from uint16_t to uint32_t to support
    larger license counts.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.pre2
=============================
 -- Log a job's requeue or cancellation due to preemption to that job's stderr:
    "*** JOB 65547 CANCELLED AT 2011-01-21T12:59:33 DUE TO PREEMPTION ***".
 -- Added new job termination state of JOB_PREEMPTED, "PR" or "PREEMPTED" to
    indicate job termination was due to preemption.
 -- Optimize advanced reservations resource selection for computer topology.
    The logic has been added to select/linear and select/cons_res, but will
    not be enabled until the other select plugins are modified.
 -- Remove checkpoint/xlch plugin.
 -- Disable deletion of partitions that have unfinished jobs (pending,
    running or suspended states). Patch from Martin Perry, BULL.
 -- In sview, disable the sorting of node records by name at startup for
    clusters over 1000 nodes. Users can enable this by selecting the "Name"
    tab. This change dramatically improves scalability of sview.
 -- Report error when trying to change a node's state from scontrol for Cray
    systems.
 -- Do not attempt to read the batch script for non-batch jobs. This patch
    eliminates some inappropriate error messages.
 -- Preserve NodeHostName when reordering nodes due to system topology.
 -- On Cray/ALPS systems  do node inventory before scheduling jobs.
 -- Disable some salloc options on Cray systems.
 -- Disable scontrol's wait_job command on Cray systems.
 -- Disable srun command on native Cray/ALPS systems.
 -- Updated configure option "--enable-cray-emulation" (still under
    development) to emulate a cray XT/XE system, and auto-detect a real
    Cray XT/XE systems (removed no longer needed --enable-cray configure
    option).  Building on native Cray systems requires the
    cray-MySQL-devel-enterprise rpm and expat XML parser library/headers.

* Changes in SLURM 2.3.0.pre1
=============================
 -- Added that when a slurmctld closes the connection to the database it's
    registered host and port are removed.
 -- Added flag to slurmdbd.conf TrackSlurmctldDown where if set will mark idle
    resources as down on a cluster when a slurmctld disconnects or is no
    longer reachable.
 -- Added support for more than one front-end node to run slurmd on
    architectures where the slurmd does not execute on the compute nodes
    (e.g. BlueGene). New configuration parameters FrontendNode and FrontendAddr
    added. See "man slurm.conf" for more information.
 -- With the scontrol show job command when using the --details option, show
    a batch job's script.
 -- Add ability to create reservations or partitions and submit batch jobs
    using sview. Also add the ability to delete reservations and partitions.
 -- Added new configuration parameter MaxJobId. Once reached, restart job ID
    values at FirstJobId.
 -- When restarting slurmctld with priority/basic, increment all job priorities
    so the highest job priority becomes TOP_PRIORITY.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.8
========================
 -- Prevent background salloc disconnecting terminal at termination. Patch by
    Don Albert, Bull.
 -- Fixed issue where preempt mode is skipped when creating a QOS. Patch by
    Bill Brophy, Bull.
 -- Fixed documention (html) for PriorityUsageResetPeriod to match that in the
    man pages. Patch by Nancy Kritkausky, Bull.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.7
========================
 -- Eliminate zombie process created if salloc exits with stopped child
    process. Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- With default configuration on non-Cray systems, enable salloc to be
    spawned as a background process. Based upon work by Don Albert (Bull) and
    Gerrit Renker (CSCS).
 -- Fixed Regression from 2.2.4 in accounting where an inherited limit
    would not be set correctly in the added child association.
 -- Fixed issue with accounting when asking for jobs with a hostlist.
 -- Avoid clearing a node's Arch, OS, BootTime and SlurmdStartTime when
    "scontrol reconfig" is run. Patch from Martin Perry, Bull.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.6
========================
 -- Fix displaying of account coordinators with sacctmgr.  Possiblity to show
    deleted accounts.  Only a cosmetic issue, since the accounts are already
    deleted, and have no associations.
 -- Prevent opaque ncurses WINDOW struct on OS X 10.6.
 -- Fix issue with accounting when using PrivateData=jobs... users would not be
    able to view there own jobs unless they were admin or coordinators which is
    obviously wrong.
 -- Fix bug in node stat if slurmctld is restarted while nodes are in the
    process of being powered up. Patch from Andriy Grytsenko.
 -- Change maximum batch script size from 128k to 4M.
 -- Get slurmd -f option working. Patch from Andriy Grytsenko.
 -- Fix for linking problem on OSX. Patches from Jon Bringhurst (LANL) and
    Tyler Strickland.
 -- Reset a job's priority to zero (suspended) when Moab requeues the job.
    Patch from Par Andersson, NSC.
 -- When enforcing accounting, fix polling for unknown uids for users after
    the slurmctld started.  Previously one would have to issue a reconfigure
    to the slurmctld to have it look for new uids.
 -- BLUEGENE - if a block goes into an error state.  Fix issue where accounting
    wasn't updated correctly when the block was resumed.
 -- Synchronize power-save module better with scheduler. Patch from
    Andriy Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- Avoid SEGV in association logic with user=NULL. Patch from
    Andriy Grytsenko (Massive Solutions Limited).
 -- Fixed issue in accounting where it was possible for a new
    association/wckey to be set incorrectly as a default the new object
    was added after an original default object already existed.  Before
    the slurmctld would need to be restarted to fix the issue.
 -- Updated the Normalized Usage section in priority_multifactor.shtml.
 -- Disable use of SQUEUE_FORMAT env var if squeue -l, -o, or -s option is
    used. Patch from Aaron Knister (UMBC).

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.5
========================
 -- Correct init.d/slurm status to have non-zero exit code if ANY Slurm
    damon that should be running on the node is not running. Patch from Rod
    Schulz, Bull.
 -- Improve accuracy of response to "srun --test-only jobid=#".
 -- Correct logic to properly support --ntasks-per-node option in the
    select/cons_res plugin. Patch from Rod Schulz, Bull.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res with respect to generic resource (gres)
    scheduling which prevented some jobs from starting as soon as possible.
 -- Fix memory leak in select/cons_res when backfill scheduling generic
    resources (gres).
 -- Fix for when configuring a node with more resources than in real life
    and using task/affinity.
 -- Fix so slurmctld will pack correctly 2.1 step information. (Only needed if
    a 2.1 client is talking to a 2.2 slurmctld.)
 -- Set powered down node's state to IDLE+POWER after slurmctld restart instead
    of leaving in UNKNOWN+POWER. Patch from Andrej Gritsenko.
 -- Fix bug where is srun's executable is not on it's current search path, but
    can be found in the user's default search path. Modify slurmstepd to find
    the executable. Patch from Andrej Gritsenko.
 -- Make sview display correct cpu count for steps.
 -- BLUEGENE - when running in overlap mode make sure to check the connection
    type so you can create overlapping blocks on the exact same nodes with
    different connection types (i.e. one torus, one mesh).
 -- Fix memory leak if MPI ports are reserved (for OpenMPI) and srun's
    --resv-ports option is used.
 -- Fix some anomalies in select/cons_res task layout when using the
    --cpus-per-task option. Patch from Martin Perry, Bull.
 -- Improve backfill scheduling logic when job specifies --ntasks-per-node and
    --mem-per-cpu options on a heterogeneous cluster. Patch from Bjorn-Helge
    Mevik, University of Oslo.
 -- Print warning message if srun specifies --cpus-per-task larger than used
    to create job allocation.
 -- Fix issue when changing a users name in accounting, if using wckeys would
    execute correctly, but bad memcopy would core the DBD.  No information
    would be lost or corrupted, but you would need to restart the DBD.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.4
========================
 -- For batch jobs for which the Prolog fails, substitute the job ID for any
    "%j" in the job's output or error file specification.
 -- Add licenses field to the sview reservation information.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for handling extremely overloaded system on Dynamic system
    dealing with starting jobs on overlapping blocks.  Previous fallout
    was job would be requeued.  (happens very rarely)
 -- In accounting_storage/filetxt plugin, substitute spaces within job names,
    step names, and account names with an underscore to insure proper parsing.
 -- When building contribs/perlapi ignore both INSTALL_BASE and PERL_MM_OPT.
    Use PREFIX instead to avoid build errors from multiple installation
    specifications.
 -- Add job_submit/cnode plugin to support resource reservations of less than
    a full midplane on BlueGene computers. Treat cnodes as liceses which can
    be reserved and are consumed by jobs. This reservation mechanism for less
    than an entire midplane is still under development.
 -- Clear a job's "reason" field when a held job is released.
 -- When releasing a held job, calculate a new priority for it rather than
    just setting the priority to 1.
 -- Fix for sview started on a non-bluegene system to pick colors correctly
    when talking to a real bluegene system.
 -- Improve sched/backfill's expected start time calculation.
 -- Prevent abort of sacctmgr for dump command with invalid (or no) filename.
 -- Improve handling of job updates when using limits in accounting, and
    updating jobs as a non-admin user.
 -- Fix for "squeue --states=all" option. Bug would show no jobs.
 -- Schedule jobs with reservations before those without reservations.
 -- Fix squeue/scancel to query correctly against accounts of different case.
 -- Abort an srun command when it's associated job gets aborted due to a
    dependency that can not be satisfied.
 -- In jobcomp plugins, report start time of zeroif pending job is cancelled.
    Previously may report expected start time.
 -- Fixed sacctmgr man to state correct variables.
 -- Select nodes based upon their Weight when job allocation requests include
    a constraint field with a count (e.g. "srun --constraint=gpu*2 -N4 a.out").
 -- Add support for user names that are entirely numeric and do not treat them
    as UID values. Patch from Dennis Leepow.
 -- Patch to un/pack double values properly if negative value.  Patch from
    Dennis Leepow
 -- Do not reset a job's priority when requeued or suspended.
 -- Fix problemm that could let new jobs start on a node in DRAINED state.
 -- Fix cosmetic sacctmgr issue where if the user you are trying to add
    doesn't exist in the /etc/passwd file and the account you are trying
    to add them to doesn't exist it would print (null) instead of the bad
    account name.
 -- Fix associations/qos for when adding back a previously deleted object
    the object will be cleared of all old limits.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added back a lock when creating dynamic blocks to be more thread
    safe on larger systems with heavy load.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.3
========================
 -- Update srun, salloc, and sbatch man page description of --distribution
    option. Patches from Rod Schulz, Bull.
 -- Applied patch from Martin Perry to fix "Incorrect results for task/affinity
    block second distribution and cpus-per-task > 1" bug.
 -- Avoid setting a job's eligible time while held (priority == 0).
 -- Substantial performance improvement to backfill scheduling. Patch from
    Bjorn-Helge Mevik, University of Oslo.
 -- Make timeout for communications to the slurmctld be based upon the
    MessageTimeout configuration parameter rather than always 3 seconds.
    Patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Add new scontrol option of "show aliases" to report every NodeName that is
    associated with a given NodeHostName when running multiple slurmd daemons
    per compute node (typically used for testing purposes). Patch from
    Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Fix for handling job names with a "'" in the name within MySQL accounting.
    Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Modify condition under which salloc execution delayed until moved to the
    foreground. Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
	Job control for interactive salloc sessions: only if ...
	a) input is from a terminal (stdin has valid termios attributes),
	b) controlling terminal exists (non-negative tpgid),
	c) salloc is not run in allocation-only (--no-shell) mode,
	d) salloc runs in its own process group (true in interactive
	   shells that support job control),
	e) salloc has been configured at compile-time to support background
	   execution and is not currently in the background process group.
 -- Abort salloc if no controlling terminal and --no-shell option is not used
    ("setsid salloc ..." is disabled). Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Fix to gang scheduling logic which could cause jobs to not be suspended
    or resumed when appropriate.
 -- Applied patch from Martin Perry to fix "Slurmd abort when using task
    affinity with plane distribution" bug.
 -- Applied patch from Yiannis Georgiou to fix "Problem with cpu binding to
    sockets option" behaviour. This change causes "--cpu_bind=sockets" to bind
    tasks only to the CPUs on each socket allocated to the job rather than all
    CPUs on each socket.
 -- Advance daily or weekly reservations immediately after termination to avoid
    having a job start that runs into the reservation when later advanced.
 -- Fix for enabling users to change there own default account, wckey, or QOS.
 -- BLUEGENE - If using OVERLAP mode fixed issue with multiple overlapping
    blocks in error mode.
 -- Fix for sacctmgr to display correctly default accounts.
 -- scancel -s SIGKILL will always sent the RPC to the slurmctld rather than
    the slurmd daemon(s). This insures that tasks in the process of getting
    spawned are killed.
 -- BLUEGENE - If using OVERLAP mode fixed issue with jobs getting denied
    at submit if the only option for their job was overlapping a block in
    error state.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.2
========================
 -- Correct logic to set correct job hold state (admin or user) when setting
    the job's priority using scontrol's "update jobid=..." rather than its
    "hold" or "holdu" commands.
 -- Modify squeue to report unset --mincores, --minthreads or --extra-node-info
    values as "*" rather than 65534. Patch from Rod Schulz, BULL.
 -- Report the StartTime of a job as "Unknown" rather than the year 2106 if its
    expected start time was too far in the future for the backfill scheduler
    to compute.
 -- Prevent a pending job reason field from inappropriately being set to
    "Priority".
 -- In sched/backfill with jobs having QOS_FLAG_NO_RESERVE set, then don't
    consider the job's time limit when attempting to backfill schedule. The job
    will just be preempted as needed at any time.
 -- Eliminated a bug in sbatch when no valid target clusters are specified.
 -- When explicitly sending a signal to a job with the scancel command and that
    job is in a pending state, then send the request directly to the slurmctld
    daemon and do not attempt to send the request to slurmd daemons, which are
    not running the job anyway.
 -- In slurmctld, properly set the up_node_bitmap when setting it's state to
    IDLE (in case the previous node state was DOWN).
 -- Fix smap to process block midplane names correctly when on a bluegene
    system.
 -- Fix smap to once again print out the Letter 'ID' for each line of a block/
    partition view.
 -- Corrected the NOTES section of the scancel man page
 -- Fix for accounting_storage/mysql plugin to correctly query cluster based
    transactions.
 -- Fix issue when updating database for clusters that were previously deleted
    before upgrade to 2.2 database.
 -- BLUEGENE - Handle mesh torus check better in dynamic mode.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed race condition when freeing block, most likely only would
    happen in emulation.
 -- Fix for calculating used QOS limits correctly on a slurmctld reconfig.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for bad conn-type set when running small blocks in HTC mode.
 -- If salloc's --no-shell option is used, then do not attempt to preserve the
    terminal's state.
 -- Add new SLURM configure time parameter of --disable-salloc-background. If
    set, then salloc can only execute in the foreground. If started in the
    background, then a message will be printed and the job allocation halted
    until brought into the foreground.
    NOTE: THIS IS A CHANGE IN DEFAULT SALLOC BEHAVIOR FROM V2.2.1, BUT IS
    CONSISTENT WITH V2.1 AND EARLIER.
 -- Added the Multi-Cluster Operation web page.
 -- Removed remnant code for enforcing max sockets/cores/threads in the
    cons_res plugin (see last item in 2.1.0-pre5).  This was responsible
    for a bug reported by Rod Schultz.
 -- BLUEGENE - Set correct env vars for HTC mode on a P system to get correct
    block.
 -- Correct RunTime reported by "scontrol show job" for pending jobs.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.1
========================
 -- Fix setting derived exit code correctly for jobs that happen to have the
    same jobid.
 -- Better checking for time overflow when rolling up in accounting.
 -- Add scancel --reservation option to cancel all jobs associated with a
    specific reservation.
 -- Treat reservation with no nodes like one that starts later (let jobs of any
    size get queued and do not block any pending jobs).
 -- Fix bug in gang scheduling logic that would temporarily resume to many jobs
    after a job completed.
 -- Change srun message about job step being deferred due to SlurmctldProlog
    running to be more clear and only print when --verbose option is used.
 -- Made it so you could remove the hold on jobs with sview by setting the
    priority to infinite.
 -- BLUEGENE - better checking small blocks in dynamic mode whether a full
    midplane job could run or not.
 -- Decrease the maximum sleep time between srun job step creation retry
    attempts from 60 seconds to 29 seconds. This should eliminate a possible
    synchronization problem with gang scheduling that could result in job
    step creation requests only occuring when a job is suspended.
 -- Fix to prevent changing a held job's state from HELD to DEPENDENCY
    until the job is released. Patch from Rod Schultz, Bull.
 -- Fixed sprio -M to reflect PriorityWeight values from remote cluster.
 -- Fix bug in sview when trying to update arbitrary field on more than one
    job. Formerly would display information about one job, but update next
    selected job.
 -- Made it so QOS with UsageFactor set to 0 would make it so jobs running
    under that QOS wouldn't add time to fairshare or association/qos
    limits.
 -- Fixed issue where QOS priority wasn't re-normalized until a slurmctld
    restart when a QOS priority was changed.
 -- Fix sprio to use calculated numbers from slurmctld instead of
    calulating it own numbers.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed race condition with preemption where if the wind blows the
    right way the slurmctld could lock up when preempting jobs to run others.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed epilog to wait until MMCS job is totally complete before
    finishing.
 -- BLUEGENE - more robust checking for states when freeing blocks.
 -- Added correct files to the slurm.spec file for correct perl api rpm
    creation.
 -- Added flag "NoReserve" to a QOS to make it so all jobs are created equal
    within a QOS.  So if larger, higher priority jobs are unable to run they
    don't prevent smaller jobs from running even if running the smaller
    jobs delay the start of the larger, higher priority jobs.
 -- BLUEGENE - Check preemptees one by one to preempt lower priority jobs first
    instead of first fit.
 -- In select/cons_res, correct handling of the option
    SelectTypeParameters=CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE.
 -- Fix for checking QOS to override partition limits, previously if not using
    QOS some limits would be overlooked.
 -- Fix bug which would terminate a job step if any of the nodes allocated to
    it were removed from the job's allocation. Now only the tasks on those
    nodes are terminated.
 -- Fixed issue when using a storage_accounting plugin directly without the
    slurmDBD updates weren't always sent correctly to the slurmctld, appears to
    OS dependent, reported by Fredrik Tegenfeldt.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0
========================
 -- Change format of Duration field in "scontrol show reservation" output from
    an integer number of minutes to "[days-]hours:minutes:seconds".
 -- Add support for changing the reservation of pending or running jobs.
 -- On Cray systems only, salloc sends SIGKILL to spawned process group when
    job allocation is revoked. Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Fix for sacctmgr to work correctly when modifying user associations where
    all the associations contain a partition.
 -- Minor mods to salloc signal handling logic: forwards more signals and
    releases allocation on real-time signals. Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Add salloc logic to preserve tty attributes after abnormal exit. Patch
    from Mark Grondona, LLNL.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for issue in dynamic mode when trying to create a block
    overlapping a block with no job running on it but in configuring state.
 -- BLUEGENE - Speedup by skipping blocks that are deallocating for other jobs
    when starting overlapping jobs in dynamic mode.
 -- Fix for sacct --state to work correctly when not specifying a start time.
 -- Fix upgrade process in accounting from 2.1 for clusters named "cluster".
 -- Export more jobacct_common symbols needed for the slurm api on some systems.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.rc4
============================
 -- Correction in logic to spread out over time highly parallel messages to
    minimize lost messages. Effects slurmd epilog complete messages and PMI
    key-pair transmissions. Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Fixed issue where if a system has unset messages to the dbd in 2.1 and
    upgrades to 2.2.  Messages are now processed correctly now.
 -- Fixed issue where assoc_mgr cache wasn't always loaded correctly if the
    slurmdbd wasn't running when the slurmctld was started.
 -- Make sure on a pthread create in step launch that the error code is looked
    at. Improves fault-tolerance of slurmd.
 -- Fix setting up default acct/wckey when upgrading from 2.1 to 2.2.
 -- Fix issue with associations attached to a specific partition with no other
    association, and requesting a different partition.
 -- Added perlapi to the slurmdb to the slurm.spec.
 -- In sched/backfill, correct handling of CompleteWait parameter to avoid
    backfill scheduling while a job is completing. Patch from Gerrit Renker,
    CSCS.

    that user ID. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix it so 1 midplane clusters will run small block jobs.
 -- Add Command and WorkDir to the output of "scontrol show job" for job
    allocations created using srun (not just sbatch).
 -- Fixed sacctmgr to not add blank defaultqos' when doing a cluster dump.
 -- Correct processing of memory and disk space specifications in the salloc,
    sbatch, and srun commands to work properly with a suffix of "MB", "GB",
    etc. and not only with a single letter (e.g. "M", "G", etc.).
 -- Prevent nodes with suspended jobs from being powered down by SLURM.
 -- Normalized the way pidfile are created by the slurm daemons.
 -- Fixed modifying the root association to no read in it's last value
    when clearing a limit being set.
 -- Revert some resent signal handling logic from salloc so that SIGHUP sent
    after the job allocation will properly release the allocation and cause
    salloc to exit.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for recreating a block in a ready state.
 -- Fix debug flags for incorrect logic when dealing with DEBUG_FLAG_WIKI.
 -- Report reservation's Nodes as a hostlist expression of all nodes rather
    than using "ALL".
 -- Fix reporting of nodes in BlueGene reservation (was reporting CPU count
    rather than cnode count in scontrol output for NodeCnt field).

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.rc3
============================
 -- Modify sacctmgr command to accept plural versions of options (e.g. "Users"
    in addition to "User"). Patch from Don Albert, BULL.
 -- BLUEGENE - make it so reset of boot counter happens only on state change
    and not when a new job comes along.
 -- Modify srun and salloc signal handling so they can be interrupted while
    waiting for an allocation. This was broken in version 2.2.0.rc2.
 -- Fix NULL pointer reference in sview. Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Fix file descriptor leak in slurmstepd on spank_task_post_fork() failure.
    Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Fix bug in preserving job state information when upgrading from SLURM
    version 2.1. Bug introduced in version 2.2.0-pre10. Patch from Par
    Andersson, NSC.
 -- Fix bug where if using the slurmdbd if a job wasn't able to start right
    away some accounting information may be lost.
 -- BLUEGENE - when a prolog failure happens the offending block is put in
    an error state.
 -- Changed the last column heading of the sshare output from "FS Usage" to
    "FairShare" and added more detail to the sshare man page.
 -- Fix bug in enforcement of reservation by account name. Used wrong index
    into an array. Patch from Gerrit Renker, CSCS.
 -- Modify job_submit/lua plugin to treat any non-zero return code from the
    job_submit and job_modify functions as an error and the user request should
    be aborted.
 -- Fix bug which would permit pending job to be started on completing node
    when job preemption is configured.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.rc2
============================
 -- Fix memory leak in job step allocation logic. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- If a preempted job was submitted with the --no-requeue option then cancel
    rather than requeue it.
 -- Fix for problems when adding a user for the first time to a new cluster
    with a 2.1 sacctmgr without specifying a default account.
 -- Resend TERMINATE_JOB message only to nodes that the job still has not
    terminated on. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Treat time limit specification of "0:300" as a request for 300 seconds
    (5 minutes) instead of one minute.
 -- Modify sched/backfill plugin logic to continue working its way down the
    queue of jobs rather than restarting at the top if there are no changes in
    job, node, or partition state between runs. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Improve scalability of select/cons_res logic. Patch from Matthieu Hautreux,
    CEA.
 -- Fix for possible deadlock in the slurmstepd when cancelling a job that is
    also writing a large amount of data to stderr.
 -- Fix in select/cons_res to eliminate "mem underflow" error when the
    slurmctld is reconfigured while a job is in completing state.
 -- Send a message to the a user's job when it's real or virual memory limit
    is exceeded. :
 -- Apply rlimits right before execing the users task so to lower the risk of
    the task exiting because the slurmstepd ran over a limit (log file size,
    etc.)
 -- Add scontrol command of "uhold <job_id>" so that an administrator can hold
    a job and let the job's owner release it. The scontrol command of
    "hold <job_id>" when executed by a SLURM administrator can only be released
    by a SLURM administrator and not the job owner.
 -- Change atoi to slurm_atoul in mysql plugin, needed for running on 32-bit
    systems in some cases.
 -- If a batch job is found to be missing from a node, make its termination
    state be NODE_FAIL rather than CANCELLED.
 -- Fatal error put back if running a bluegene or cray plugin from a controller
    not of that type.
 -- Make sure jobacct_gather plugin is not shutdown before messing with the
    proccess list.
 -- Modify signal handling in srun and salloc commands to avoid deadlock if the
    malloc function is interupted and called again. The malloc function is
    thread safe, but not reentrant, which is a problem when signal handling if
    the malloc function itself has a lock. Problem fixed by moving signal
    handling in those commands to a new pthread.
 -- In srun set job abort flag on completion to handle the case when a user
    cancels a job while the node is not responding but slurmctld has not yet
    the node down. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Streamline the PMI logic if no duplicate keys are included in the key-pairs
    managed. Substantially improves performance for large numbers of tasks.
    Adds support for SLURM_PMI_KVS_NO_DUP_KEYS environment variable. Patch
    from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Fix issues with sview dealing with older versions of sview and saving
    defaults.
 -- Remove references to --mincores, --minsockets, and --minthreads from the
    salloc, sbatch and srun man pages. These options are defunct, Patch from
    Rod Schultz, Bull.
 -- Made openssl not be required to build RPMs, it is not required anymore
    since munge is the default crypto plugin.
 -- sacctmgr now has smarts to figure out if a qos is a default qos when
    modifing a user/acct or removing a qos.
 -- For reservations on BlueGene systems, set and report c-node counts rather
    than midplane counts.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.rc1
============================
 -- Add show_flags parameter to the slurm_load_block_info() function.
 -- perlapi has been brought up to speed courtesy of Hongjia Coa. (make sure to

 -- Fixed issue when using old mysql that can't handle a '.' in the table
    name.
 -- Mysql plugin works correctly without the SlurmDBD

    is stored for the batch step, but the internals are inplace if we decide to
    do that in the future.
 -- Fixed some backwards compatibility issues with 2.2 talking to 2.1.
 -- Fixed regression where modifying associations didn't get sent to the
    slurmctld.
 -- Made sshare sort things the same way saccmgr list assoc does
    (alphabetically)
 -- Fixed issue with default accounts being set up correctly.
 -- Changed sortting in the slurmctld so sshare output is similar to that of
    sacctmgr list assoc.
 -- Modify reservation logic so that daily and weekly reservations maintain
    the same time when daylight savings time starts or ends in the interim.
 -- Edit to make reservations handle updates to associations.

 -- Added ability to use sstat/sacct against the batch step.
 -- Added OnlyDefaults option to sacctmgr list associations.
 -- Modified the fairshare priority formula to F = 2**(-Ue/S)
 -- Modify the PMI functions key-pair exchange function to support a 32-bit
    counter for larger job sizes. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- In sched/builtin - Make the estimated job start time logic faster (borrowed
    new logic from sched/backfill and added pthread) and more accurate.
 -- In select/cons_res fix bug that could result in a job being allocated zero
    CPUs on some nodes. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Fix bug in sched/backfill that could set expected start time of a job too
    far in the future.
 -- Added ability to enforce new limits given to associations/qos on
    pending jobs.
 -- Increase max message size for the slurmdbd from 1000000 to 16*1024*1024
 -- Increase number of active threads in the slurmdbd from 50 to 100
 -- Fixed small bug in src/common/slurmdb_defs.c reported by Bjorn-Helge Mevik
 -- Fixed sacctmgr's ability to query associations against qos again.
 -- Fixed sview show config on non-bluegene systems.
 -- Fixed bug in selecting jobs based on sacct -N option
 -- Fix bug that prevented job Epilog from running more than once on a node if
    a job was requeued and started no job steps.
 -- Fixed issue where node index wasn't stored correcting when using DBD.
 -- Enable srun's use of the --nodes option with --exclusive (previously the
    --nodes option was ignored).
 -- Added UsageThreshold and Flags to the QOS object.
 -- Patch to improve threadsafeness in the mysql plugins.
 -- Add support for fair-share scheduling to be based upon resource use at
    the level of bank accounts and ignore use of individual users. Patch by
    Par Andersson, National Supercomputer Centre, Sweden.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre12
==============================
 -- Log if Prolog or Epilog run for longer than MessageTimeout / 2.
 -- Log the RPC number associated with messages from slurmctld that timeout.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res logic when job allocation includes --overcommit
    and --ntasks-per-node options and the node has fewer CPUs than the count
    specified by --ntasks-per-node.
 -- Fix bug in gang scheduling and job preemption logic so that preempted jobs
    get resumed properly after a slurmctld hot-start.
 -- Fix bug in select/linear handling of gang scheduled jobs that could result
    in run_job_cnt underflow error message.
 -- Fix bug in gang scheduling logic to properly support partitions added
    using the scontrol command.
 -- Fix a segmentation fault in sview where the 'excluded_partitions' field
    was set to NULL, caused by the absence of ~/.slurm/sviewrc.
 -- Rewrote some calls to is_user_any_coord() in src/plugins/accounting_storage
    modules to make use of is_user_any_coord()'s return value.
 -- Add configure option of --with=dimensions=#.
 -- Modify srun ping logic so that srun would only be considered not responsive
    if three ping messages were not responded to. Patch from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- Preserve a node's ReasonTime field after scontrol reconfig command. Patch
    from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- Added the authority for users with AdminLevel's defined in the SLURM db
    (Operators and Admins) and account coordinators to invoke commands that
    affect jobs, reservations, nodes, etc.
 -- Fix for slurmd restart on completing node with no tasks to get the correct
    state, completing. Patch from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- Prevent scontrol setting a node's Reason="". Patch from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- Add new functions hostlist_ranged_string_malloc,
    hostlist_ranged_string_xmalloc, hostlist_deranged_string_malloc, and
    hostlist_deranged_string_xmalloc which will allocate memory as needed.
 -- Make the slurm commands support both the --cluster and --clusters option.
    Previously, some commands support one of those options, but not the other.
 -- Fix bug when resizing a job that has steps running on some of those nodes.
    Avoid killing the job step on remaining nodes. Patch from Rod Schultz
    (BULL). Also fix bug related to tracking the CPUs allocated to job steps
    on each node after releasing some nodes from the job's allocation.
 -- Applied patch from Rod Schultz / Matthieu Hautreux to keep the Node-to-Host
    cache from becoming corrupted when a hostname cannot be resolved.
 -- Export more symbols in libslurm for job and node state information
    translation (numbers to strings). Patch from Hongia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Add logic to retry sending RESPONSE_LAUNCH_TASKS messages from slurmd to
    srun. Patch from Hongia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Modify bit_unfmt_hexmask() and bit_unfmt_binmask() functions to clear the
    bitmap input before setting the bits indicated in the input string.
 -- Add SchedulerParameters option of bf_window to control how far into the
    future that the backfill scheduler will look when considering jobs to start.
    The default value is one day. See "man slurm.conf" for details.
 -- Fix bug that can result in duplicate job termination records in accounting
    for job termination when slurmctld restarts or reconfigures.
 -- Modify plugin and library logic as needed to support use of the function
    slurm_job_step_stat() from user commands.
 -- Fix race condition in which PrologSlurmctld failure could cause slurmctld
    to abort.
 -- Fix bug preventing users in secondary user groups from being granted access
    to partitions configured with AllowGroups.
 -- Added support for a default account and wckey per cluster within accounting.
 -- Modified select/cons_res plugin so that if MaxMemPerCPU is configured and a
    job specifies it's memory requirement, then more CPUs than requested will
    automatically be allocated to a job to honor the MaxMemPerCPU parameter.
 -- Added the derived_ec (exit_code) member to job_info_t.  exit_code captures
    the exit code of the job script (or salloc) while derived_ec contains the
    highest exit code of all the job steps.
 -- Added SLURM_JOB_EXIT_CODE and SLURM_JOB_DERIVED_EC variables to the
    EpilogSlurmctld environment
 -- More work done on the accounting_storage/pgsql plugin, still beta.
    Patch from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- Major updates to sview from Dan Rusak (Bull), including:
    - Persistent option selections for each tab page
    - Clean up topology in grids
    - Leverage AllowGroups and Hidden options
    - Cascade full-info popups for ease of selection
 -- Add locks around the MySQL calls for proper operation if the non-thread
    safe version of the MySQL library is used.
 -- Remove libslurm.a, libpmi.a and libslurmdb.a from SLURM RPM. These static
    libraries are not generally usable.
 -- Fixed bug in sacctmgr when zeroing raw usage reported by Gerrit Renker.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre11
==============================
 -- Permit a regular user to change the partition of a pending job.
 -- Major re-write of the job_submit/lua plugin to pass pointers to available
    partitions and use lua metatables to reference the job and partition fields.
 -- Add support for serveral new trigger types: SlurmDBD failure/restart,
    Database failure/restart, Slurmctld failure/restart.
 -- Add support for SLURM_CLUSTERS environment variable in the sbatch, sinfo,
    squeue commands.
 -- Modify the sinfo and squeue commands to report state of multiple clusters
    if the --clusters option is used.
 -- Added printf __attribute__ qualifiers to info, debug, ... to help prevent
    bad/incorrect parameters being sent to them.  Original patch from
    Eygene Ryabinkin (Russian Research Centre).
 -- Fix bug in slurmctld job completion logic when nodes allocated to a
    completing job are re-booted. Patch from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- In slurmctld's node record data structure, rename "hilbert_integer" to
    "node_rank".
 -- Add topology/node_rank plugin to sort nodes based upon rank loaded from
    BASIL on Cray computers.
 -- Fix memory leak in the auth/munge and crypto/munge plugins in the case of
    some failure modes.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre10
==============================
 -- Fix issue when EnforcePartLimits=yes in slurm.conf all jobs where no nodecnt
    was specified the job would be seen to have maxnodes=0 which would not
    allow jobs to run.
 -- Fix issue where if not suspending a job the gang scheduler does the correct
    kill procedure.
 -- Fixed some issues when dealing with jobs from a 2.1 system so they live
    after an upgrade.
 -- In srun, log if --cpu_bind options are specified, but not supported by the
    current system configuration.
 -- Various Patchs from Hongjia Cao dealing with bugs found in sacctmgr and
    the slurmdbd.
 -- Fix bug in changing the nodes allocated to a running job and some node
    names specified are invalid, avoid invalid memory reference.
 -- Fixed filename substitution of %h and %n based on patch from Ralph Bean
 -- Added better job sorting logic when preempting jobs with qos.
 -- Log the IP address and port number for some communication errors.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res when --cpus_per_task option is used, could
    oversubscribe resources.
 -- In srun, do not implicitly set the job's maximum node count based upon a
    required hostlist.
 -- Avoid running the HealthCheckProgram on non-responding nodes rather than
    DOWN nodes.
 -- Fix bug in handling of poll() functions on OS X (SLURM was ignoring POLLIN
    if POLLHUP flag was set at the same time).
 -- Pulled Cray logic out of common/node_select.c into it's own
    select/cray plugin cons_res is the default.  To use linear add 'Linear' to
    SelectTypeParameters.
 -- Fixed bug where resizing jobs didn't correctly set used limits correctly.
 -- Change sched/backfill default time interval to 30 seconds and defer attempt
    to backfill schedule if slurmctld has more than 5 active RPCs. General
    improvements in logic scalability.
 -- Add SchedulerParameters option of default_sched_depth=# to control how
    many jobs on queue should be tested for attempted scheduling when a job
    completes or other routine events. Default value is 100 jobs. The full job
    queue is tested on a less frequent basis. This option can dramatically
    improve performance on systems with thousands of queued jobs.
 -- Gres/gpu now sets the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment to control which
    GPU devices should be used for each job or job step and CUDA version 3.1+
    is used. NOTE: SLURM's generic resource support is still under development.
 -- Modify select/cons_res to pack jobs onto allocated nodes differently and
    minimize system fragmentation. For example on nodes with 8 CPUs each, a
    job needing 10 CPUs will now ideally be allocated 8 CPUs on one node and
    2 CPUs on another node. Previously the job would have ideally been
    allocated 5 CPUs on each node, fragmenting the unused resources more.
 -- Modified the behavior of update_job() in job_mgr.c to return when the first
    error is encountered instead of continuing with more job updates.
 -- Removed all references to the following slurm.conf parameters, all of which
    have been removed or replaced since version 2.0 or earlier: HashBase,
    HeartbeatInterval, JobAcctFrequency, JobAcctLogFile (instead use
    AccountingStorageLoc), JobAcctType, KillTree, MaxMemPerTask, and
    MpichGmDirectSupport.
 -- Fix bug in slurmctld restart logic that improperly reported jobs had
    invalid features: "Job 65537 has invalid feature list: fat".
 -- BLUEGENE - Removed thread pool for destroying blocks.  It turns out the
    memory leak we were concerned about for creating and destroying threads
    in a plugin doesn't exist anymore.  This increases throughput dramatically,
    allowing multiple jobs to start at the same time.
 -- BLUEGENE - Removed thread pool for starting and stopping jobs.  For similar
    reasons as noted above.
 -- BLUEGENE - Handle blocks that never deallocate.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre9
=============================
 -- sbatch can now submit jobs to multiple clusters and run on the earliest
    available.
 -- Fix bug introduced in pre8 that prevented job dependencies and job
    triggers from working without the --enable-debug configure option.
 -- Replaced slurm_addr with slurm_addr_t
 -- Replaced slurm_fd with slurm_fd_t
 -- Skeleton code added for BlueGeneQ.
 -- Jobs can now be submitted to multiple partitions (job queues) and use the
    one permitting earliest start time.
 -- Change slurmdb_coord_table back to acct_coord_table to keep consistant
    with < 2.1.
 -- Introduced locking system similar to that in the slurmctld for the
    assoc_mgr.
 -- Added ability to change a users name in accounting.
 -- Restore squeue support for "%G" format (group id) accidentally removed in
    2.2.0.pre7.
 -- Added preempt_mode option to QOS.
 -- Added a grouping=individual for sreport size reports.
 -- Added remove_qos logic to jobs running under a QOS that was removed.
 -- scancel now exits with a 1 if any job is non-existant when canceling.
 -- Better handling of select plugins that don't exist on various systems for
    cross cluster communication.  Slurmctld, slurmd, and slurmstepd now only
    load the default select plugin as well.
 -- Better error handling when loading plugins.
 -- Prevent scontrol from aborting if getlogin() returns NULL.
 -- Prevent scontrol segfault when there are hidden nodes.
 -- Prevent srun segfault after task launch failure.
 -- Added job_submit/lua plugin.
 -- Fixed sinfo on a bluegene system to print correctly the output for:
    sinfo -e -o "%9P %6m %.4c %.22F %f"
 -- Add scontrol commands "hold" and "release" to simplify setting a job's
    priority to 0 or 1. Also tests that the job is in pending state.
 -- Increase maximum node list size (for incoming RPC) from 1024 bytes to 64k.
 -- In the backup slurmctld, purge triggers before recovering trigger state to
    avoid duplicate entries.
 -- Fix bug in sacct processing of --fields= option.
 -- Fix bug in checkpoint/blcr for jobs spanning multiple nodes introduced when
    changing some variable names in version 2.2.0.pre5.
 -- Removed the vestigal set_max_cluster_usage() function from the Priority
    Plugin API.
 -- Modify the output of "scontrol show job" for the field ReqS:C:T=. Fields
    not specified by the user will be reported as "*" instead of 65534.
 -- Added DefaultQOS option for an association.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added -B option to the slurmctld to clear created blocks from
    the system on start.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added option to scontrol & sview to recreate existing blocks.
 -- Fixed flags for returning messages to use the correct munge key when going
    cross-cluster.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added option to scontrol & sview to resume blocks in an error
    state instead of just freeing them.
 -- sview patched to allow multiple row selection of jobs, patch from Dan Rusak
 -- Lower default slurmctld server thread count from 1024 to 256. Some systems
    process threads on a last-in first-out basis and the high thread count was
    causing unexpectedly high delays for some RPCs.
 -- Added to sacctmgr the ability for admins to reset the raw usage of a user
    or account
 -- Improved the efficiency of a few lines in sacctmgr

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre8
=============================
 -- Add DebugFlags parameter of "Backfill" for sched/backfill detailed logging.
 -- Add DebugFlags parameter of "Gang" for detailed logging of gang scheduling
    activities.
 -- Add DebugFlags parameter of "Priority" for detailed logging of priority
    multifactor activities.
 -- Add DebugFlags parameter of "Reservation" for detailed logging of advanced
    reservations.
 -- Add run time to mail message upon job termination and queue time for mail
    message upon job begin.
 -- Add email notification option for job requeue.
 -- Generate a fatal error if the srun --relative option is used when not
    within an existing job allocation.
 -- Modify the meaning of InactiveLimit slightly. It will now cancel the job
    allocation created using the salloc or srun command if those commands
    cease responding for the InactiveLimit regardless of any running job steps.
    This parameter will no longer effect jobs spawned using sbatch.
 -- Remove AccountingStoragePass and JobCompPass from configuration RPC and
    scontrol show config command output. The use of SlurmDBD is still strongly
    recommended as SLURM will have limited database functionality or protection
    otherwise.
 -- Add sbatch options of --export and SBATCH_EXPORT to control which
    environment variables (if any) get propagated to the spawned job. This is
    particularly important for jobs that are submitted on one cluster and run
    on a different cluster.
 -- Fix bug in select/linear when used with gang scheduling and there are
    preempted jobs at the time slurmctld restarts that can result in over-
    subscribing resources.
 -- Added keeping track of the qos a job is running with in accounting.
 -- Fix for handling correctly jobs that resize, and also reporting correct
    stats on a job after it finishes.
 -- Modify gang scheduler so with SelectTypeParameter=CR_CPUS and task
    affinity is enabled, keep track of the individual CPUs allocated to jobs
    rather than just the count of CPUs allocated (which could overcommit
    specific CPUs for running jobs).
 -- Modify select/linear plugin data structures to eliminate underflow errors
    for the exclusive_cnt and tot_job_cnt variables (previously happened when
    slurmctld reconfigured while the job was in completing state).
 -- Change slurmd's working directory (and location of core files) to match
    that of the slurmctld daemon: the same directory used for log files,
    SlurmdLogFile (if specified with an absolute pathname) otherwise the
    directory used to save state, SlurmdSpoolDir.
 -- Add sattach support for the --pty option.
 -- Modify slurmctld communications logic to accept incoming messages on more
    than one port for improved scalability.
 -- Add SchedulerParameters option of "defer" to avoid trying to schedule a
    job at submission time, but to attempt scheduling many jobs at once for
    improved performance under heavy load.
 -- Correct logic controlling slurmctld thread limit eliminating check of
    RLIMIT_STACK.
 -- Make slurmctld's trigger logic more robust in the event that job records
    get purged before their trigger can be processed (e.g. MinJobAge=1).
 -- Add support for users to hold/release their own jobs (submit the job with
    srun/sbatch --hold/-H option or use "scontrol update jobid=# priority=0"
    to hold and "scontrol update jobid=# priority=1" to release).
 -- Added ability for sacct to query jobs by qos and a range of timelimits.
 -- Added ability for sstat to query pids of steps running.
 -- Support time specification in UTS format with a prefix of "uts" (e.g.
    "sbatch --begin=uts458389988 my.script").

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre7
=============================
 -- Fixed issue with sacctmgr if querying against non-existent cluster it
    works the same way as 2.1.
 -- Added infrastructure to support allocation of generic node resources (gres).
    -Modified select/linear and select/cons_res plugins to allocate resources
     at the level of a job without oversubcription.
    -Get sched/backfill operating with gres allocations.
    -Get gres configuration changes (reconfiguration) working.
    -Have job steps allocate resources.
    -Modified job step credential to include the job's and step's gres
     allocation details.
    -Integrate with HWLOC library to identify GPUs and NICs configured on each
     node.
 -- SLURM commands (squeue, sinfo, etc...) can now go cross-cluster on like
    linux systems.  Cross-cluster for bluegene to linux and such should
    work fine, even sview.
 -- Added the ability to configure PreemptMode on a per-partition basis.
 -- Change slurmctld's default thread limit count to 1024, but adjust that down
    as needed based upon the process's resource limits.
 -- Removed the non-functional "SystemCPU" and "TotalCPU" reporting fields from
    sstat and updated man page
 -- Correct location of apbasil command on Cray XT systems.
 -- Fixed bug in MinCPU and AveCPU calculations in sstat command
 -- Send message to srun when the Prolog takes too long (MessageTimeout) to
    complete.
 -- Change timeout for socket connect() to be half of configured MessageTimeout.
 -- Added high-throughput computing web page with configuration guidance.
 -- Use more srun sockets to process incoming PMI (MPICH2) connections for
    better scalability.
 -- Added DebugFlags for the select/bluegene plugin: DEBUG_FLAG_BG_PICK,
    DEBUG_FLAG_BG_WIRES, DEBUG_FLAG_BG_ALGO, and DEBUG_FLAG_BG_ALGO_DEEP.
 -- Remove vestigial job record field "kill_on_step_done" (internal to the
    slurmctld daemon only).
 -- For MPICH2 jobs: Clear PMI state between job steps.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre6
=============================
 -- sview - added ability to see database configuration.
 -- sview - added ability to add/remove visible tabs.
 -- sview - change way grid highlighting takes place on selected objects.
 -- Added infrastructure to support allocation of generic node resources.
    -Added node configuration parameter of Gres=.
    -Added ability to view/modify a node's gres using scontrol, sinfo and sview.
    -Added salloc, sbatch and srun --gres option.
    -Added ability to view a job or job step's gres using scontrol, squeue and
     sview.
    -Added new configuration parameter GresPlugins to define plugins used to
     manage generic resources.
    -Added framework for gres plugins.
    -Added DebugFlags option of "gres" for detailed debugging of gres actions.
 -- Slurmd modified to log slow slurmstepd startup and note possible file system
    problem.
 -- sview - There is now a .slurm/sviewrc created when running sview.
    Defaults are put in there as to how sview looks when first launched.
    You can set these by Ctrl-S or Options->Set Default Settings.
 -- Add scontrol "wait_job <job_id>" option to wait for nodes to boot as needed.
    Useful for batch jobs (in Prolog, PrologSlurmctld or the script) if powering
    down idle nodes.
 -- Added salloc and sbatch option --wait-all-nodes. If set non-zero, job
    initiation will be delayed until all allocated nodes have booted. Salloc
    will log the delay with the messages "Waiting for nodes to boot" and "Nodes
    are ready for job".
 -- The Priority/mulitfactor plugin now takes into consideration size of job
    in cpus as well as size in nodes when looking at the job size factor.
    Previously only nodes were considered.
 -- When using the SlurmDBD messages waiting to be sent will be combined
    and sent in one message.
 -- Remove srun's --core option. Move the logic to an optional SPANK plugin
    (currently in the contribs directory, but plan to distribute through
    http://code.google.com/p/slurm-spank-plugins/).
 -- Patch for adding CR_CORE_DEFAULT_DIST_BLOCK as a select option to layout
    jobs using block layout across cores within each node instead of cyclic
    which was previously the default.
 -- Accounting - When removing associations if jobs are running, those jobs
    must be killed before proceeding.  Before the jobs were killed
    automatically thus causing user confusion on what is most likely an
    admin's mistake.
 -- sview - color column keeps reference color when highlighting.
 -- Configuration parameter MaxJobCount changed from 16-bit to 32-bit field.
    The default MaxJobCount was changed from 5,000 to 10,000.
 -- SLURM commands (squeue, sinfo, etc...) can now go cross-cluster on like
    linux systems.  Cross-cluster for bluegene to linux and such does not
    currently work.  You can submit jobs with sbatch.  Salloc and srun are not
    cross-cluster compatible, and given their nature to talk to actual compute
    nodes these will likely never be.
 -- salloc modified to forward SIGTERM to the spawned program.
 -- In sched/wiki2 (for Moab support) - Add GRES and WCKEY fields to MODIFYJOBS
    and GETJOBS commands. Add GRES field to GETNODES command.
 -- In struct job_descriptor and struct job_info: rename min_sockets to
    sockets_per_node, min_cores to cores_per_socket, and min_threads to
    threads_per_core (the values are not minimum, but represent the target
    values).
 -- Fixed bug in clearing a partition's DisableRootJobs value reported by
    Hongjia Cao.
 -- Purge (or ignore) terminated jobs in a more timely fashion based upon the
    MinJobAge configuration parameter. Small values for MinJobAge should improve
    responsiveness for high job throughput.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre5
=============================
 -- Modify commands to accept time format with one or two digit hour value
    (e.g. 8:00 or 08:00 or 8:00:00 or 08:00:00).
 -- Modify time parsing logic to accept "minute", "hour", "day", and "week" in
    addition to the currently accepted "minutes", "hours", etc.
 -- Add slurmd option of "-C" to print actual hardware configuration and exit.
 -- Pass EnforcePartLimits configuration parameter from slurmctld for user
    commands to see the correct value instead of always "NO".
 -- Modify partition data structures to replace the default_part,
    disable_root_jobs, hidden and root_only fields with a single field called
    "flags" populated with the flags PART_FLAG_DEFAULT, PART_FLAG_NO_ROOT
    PART_FLAG_HIDDEN and/or PART_FLAG_ROOT_ONLY. This is a more flexible
    solution besides making for smaller data structures.
 -- Add node state flag of JOB_RESIZING. This will only exist when a job's
    accounting record is being written immediately before or after it changes
    size. This permits job accounting records to be written for a job at each
    size.
 -- Make calls to jobcomp and accounting_storage plugins before and after a job
    changes size (with the job state being JOB_RESIZING). All plugins write a
    record for the job at each size with intermediate job states being
    JOB_RESIZING.
 -- When changing a job size using scontrol, generate a script that can be
    executed by the user to reset SLURM environment variables.
 -- Modify select/linear and select/cons_res to use resources released by job
    resizing.
 -- Added to contribs foundation for Perl extension for slurmdb library.
 -- Add new configuration parameter JobSubmitPlugins which provides a mechanism
    to set default job parameters or perform other site-configurable actions at
    job submit time.
 -- Better postgres support for accounting, still beta.
 -- Speed up job start when using the slurmdbd.
 -- Forward step failure reason back to slurmd before in some cases it would
    just be SLURM_FAILURE returned.
 -- Changed squeue to fail when passed invalid -o <output_format> or
    -S <sort_list> specifications.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre4
=============================
 -- Add support for a PropagatePrioProcess configuration parameter value of 2
    to restrict spawned task nice values to that of the slurmd daemon plus 1.
    This insures that the slurmd daemon always have a higher scheduling
    priority than spawned tasks.
 -- Add support in slurmctld, slurmd and slurmdbd for option of "-n <value>" to
    reset the daemon's nice value.
 -- Fixed slurm_load_slurmd_status and slurm_pid2jobid to work correctly when
    multiple slurmds are in use.
 -- Altered srun to set max_nodes to min_nodes if not set when doing an
    allocation to mimic that which salloc and sbatch do.  If running a step if
    the max isn't set it remains unset.
 -- Applied patch from David Egolf (David.Egolf@Bull.com). Added the ability
    to purge/archive accounting data on a day or hour basis, previously
    it was only available on a monthly basis.
 -- Add support for maximum node count in job step request.
 -- Fix bug in CPU count logic for job step allocation (used count of CPUS per
    node rather than CPUs allocated to the job).
 -- Add new configuration parameters GroupUpdateForce and GroupUpdateTime.
    See "man slurm.conf" for details about how these control when slurmctld
    updates its information of which users are in the groups allowed to use
    partitions.
 -- Added sacctmgr list events which will list events that have happened on
    clusters in accounting.
 -- Permit a running job to shrink in size using a command of
    "scontrol update JobId=# NumNodes=#" or
    "scontrol update JobId=# NodeList=<names>". Subsequent job steps must
    explicitly specify an appropriate node count to work properly.
 -- Added resize_time field to job record noting the time of the latest job
    size change (to be used for accounting purposes).
 -- sview/smap now hides hidden partitions and their jobs by default, with an
    option to display them.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre3
=============================
 -- Refine support for TotalView partial attach. Add parameter to configure
    program of "--enable-partial-attach".
 -- In select/cons_res, the count of CPUs on required nodes was formerly
    ignored in enforcing the maximum CPU limit. Also enforce maximum CPU
    limit when the topology/tree plugin is configured (previously ignored).
 -- In select/cons_res, allocate cores for a job using a best-fit approach.
 -- In select/cons_res, for jobs that can run on a single node, use a best-fit
    packing approach.
 -- Add support for new partition states of DRAIN and INACTIVE and new partition
    option of "Alternate" (alternate partition to use for jobs submitted to
    partitions that are currently in a state of DRAIN or INACTIVE).
 -- Add group membership cache. This can substantially speed up slurmctld
    startup or reconfiguration if many partitions have AllowGroups configured.
 -- Added slurmdb api for accessing slurm DB information.
 -- In select/linear: Modify data structures for better performance and to
    avoid underflow error messages when slurmctld restarts while jobs are
    in completing state.
 -- Added hash for slurm.conf so when nodes check in to the controller it can
    verify the slurm.conf is the same as the one it is running.  If not an
    error message is displayed.  To silence this message add NO_CONF_HASH
    to DebugFlags in your slurm.conf.
 -- Added error code ESLURM_CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY and prevent circular job
    dependencies (e.g. job 12 dependent upon job 11 AND job 11 is dependent
    upon job 12).
 -- Add BootTime and SlurmdStartTime to available node information.
 -- Fixed moab_2_slurmdb to work correctly under new database schema.
 -- Slurmd will drain a compute node when the SlurmdSpoolDir is full.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre2
=============================
 -- Add support for spank_get_item() to get S_STEP_ALLOC_CORES and
    S_STEP_ALLOC_MEM. Support will remain for S_JOB_ALLOC_CORES and
    S_JOB_ALLOC_MEM.
 -- Kill individual job steps that exceed their memory limit rather than
    killing an entire job if one step exceeds its memory limit.
 -- Added configuration parameter VSizeFactor to enforce virtual memory limits
    for jobs and job steps as a percentage of their real memory allocation.
 -- Add scontrol ability to update job step's time limits.
 -- Add scontrol ability to update job's NumCPUs count.
 -- Add --time-min options to salloc, sbatch and srun. The scontrol command
    has been modified to display and modify the new field. sched/backfill
    plugin has been changed to alter time limits of jobs with the
    --time-min option if doing so permits earlier job initiation.
 -- Add support for TotalView symbol MPIR_partial_attach_ok with srun support
    to release processes which TotalView does not attach to.
 -- Add new option for SelectTypeParameters of CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE. This
    option will allocate one task per core by default. Without this option,
    by default one task will be allocated per thread on nodes with more than
    one ThreadsPerCore configured.
 -- Avoid accounting separately for a current pid corresponds to a Light Weight
    Process (Thread POSIX) appearing in the /proc directory. Only account for
    the original process (pid==tgid) to avoid accounting for memory use more
    than once.
 -- Add proctrack/cgroup plugin which uses Linux control groups (aka cgroup)
    to track processes on Linux systems having this feature enabled (kernel
    >= 2.6.24).
 -- Add logging of license transations including job_id.
 -- Add configuration parameters SlurmSchedLogFile and SlurmSchedLogLevel to
    support writing scheduling events to a separate log file.
 -- Added contribs/web_apps/chart_stats.cgi, a web app that invokes sreport to
    retrieve from the accounting storage db a user's request for job usage or
    machine utilization statistics and charts the results to a browser.
 -- Massive change to the schema in the storage_accounting/mysql plugin.  When
    starting the slurmdbd the process of conversion may take a few minutes.
    You might also see some errors such as 'error: mysql_query failed: 1206
    The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size'.  If you get this,
    do not worry, it is because your setting of innodb_buffer_pool_size in
    your my.cnf file is not set or set too low.  A decent value there should
    be 64M or higher depending on the system you are running on.  See
    RELEASE_NOTES for more information.  But setting this and then
    restarting the mysqld and slurmdbd will put things right.  After this
    change we have noticed 50-75% increase in performance with sreport and
    sacct.
 -- Fix for MaxCPUs to honor partitions of 1 node that have more than the
    maxcpus for a job.
 -- Add support for "scontrol notify <message>" to work for batch jobs.

* Changes in SLURM 2.2.0.pre1
=============================
 -- Added RunTime field to scontrol show job report
 -- Added SLURM_VERSION_NUMBER and removed SLURM_API_VERSION from
    slurm/slurm.h.
 -- Added support to handle communication with SLURM 2.1 clusters.  Job's
    should not be lost in the future when upgrading to higher versions of
    SLURM.
 -- Added withdeleted options for listing clusters, users, and accounts
 -- Remove PLPA task affinity functions due to that package being deprecated.
 -- Preserve current partition state information and node Feature and Weight
    information rather than use contents of slurm.conf file after slurmctld
    restart with -R option or SIGHUP. Replace information with contents of
    slurm.conf after slurmctld restart without -R or "scontrol reconfigure".
    See RELEASE_NOTES file fore more details.
 -- Modify SLURM's PMI library (for MPICH2) to properly execute an executable
    program stand-alone (single MPI task launched without srun).
 -- Made GrpCPUs and MaxCPUs limits work for select/cons_res.
 -- Moved all SQL dependant plugins into a seperate rpm slurm-sql.  This
    should be needed only where a connection to a database is needed (i.e.
    where the slurmdbd is running)
 -- Add command line option "no_sys_info" to PAM module to supress system
    logging of "access granted for user ...", access denied and other errors
    will still be logged.
 -- sinfo -R now has the user and timestamp in separate fields from the reason.
 -- Much functionality has been added to account_storage/pgsql.  The plugin
    is still in a very beta state.  It is still highly advised to use the
    mysql plugin, but if you feel like living on the edge or just really
    like postgres over mysql for some reason here you go. (Work done
    primarily by Hongjia Cao, NUDT.)

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.17
=========================
 -- Correct format of --begin reported in salloc, sbatch and srun --help
    message.
 -- Correct logic for regular users to increase nice value of their own jobs.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.16
=========================
 -- Fixed minor warnings from gcc-4.5
 -- Fixed initialization of accounting_stroage_enforce in the slurmctld.
 -- Fixed bug where if GrpNodes was lowered while pending jobs existed and where
    above the limit the slurmctld would seg fault.
 -- Fixed minor memory leak when unpack error happens on an
    association_shares_object_t.
 -- Set Lft and Rgt correctly when adding association.  Fix for regression
    caused in 2.1.15, cosmetic fix only.
 -- Replaced optarg which was undefined in some spots to make sure ENV vars are
    set up correctly.
 -- When removing an account from a cluster with sacctmgr you no longer get
    a list of previously deleted associations.
 -- Fix to make jobcomp/(pg/my)sql correctly work when the database name is
    different than the default.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.15
=========================
 -- Fix bug in which backup slurmctld can purge job scripts (and kill batch
    jobs) when it assumes primary control, particularly when this happens
    multiple times in a short time interval.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 add IWD (Initial Working Directory) to the
    information reported about jobs.
 -- Fix bug in calculating a daily or weekly reservation start time when the
    reservation is updated. Patch from Per Lundqvist (National Supercomputer
    Centre, Linköping University, Sweden).
 -- Fix bug in how job step memory limits are calculated when the --relative
    option is used.
 -- Restore operation of srun -X option to forward SIGINT to spawned tasks
    without killing them.
 -- Fixed a bug in calculating the root account's raw usage reported by Par
    Andersson
 -- Fixed a bug in sshare displaying account hierarchy reported by Per
    Lundqvist.
 -- In select/linear plugin, when a node allocated to a running job is removed
    from a partition, only log the event once. Fixes problem reported by Per
    Lundqvist.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.14
=========================
 -- Fixed coding mistakes in _slurm_rpc_resv_show() and job_alloc_info() found
    while reviewing the code.
 -- Fix select/cons_res logic to prevent allocating resources while jobs
    previously allocated resources on the node are still completing.
 -- Fixed typo in job_mgr.c dealing with qos instead of associations.
 -- Make sure associations and qos' are initiated when added.
 -- Fixed wrong initialization for wckeys in the association manager.
 -- Added wiki.conf configuration parameter of HidePartitionNodes. See
    "man wiki.conf" for more information.
 -- Add "JobAggregationTime=#" field SchedulerParameter configuration parameter
    output.
 -- Modify init.d/slurm and slurmdbd scripts to prevent the possible
    inadvertent inclusion of "." in LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
    To fail, the script would need to be executed by user root or SlurmUser
    without the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set and there would
    have to be a maliciously altered library in the working directory.
    Thanks to Raphael Geissert for identifying the problem. This addresses
    security vulnerability CVE-2010-3380.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.13
=========================
 -- Fix race condition which can set a node state to IDLE on slurmctld startup
    even if it has running jobs.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.12
=========================
 -- Fixes for building on OS X 10.5.
 -- Fixed a few '-' without a '\' in front of them in the man pages.
 -- Fixed issues in client tools where a requeued job did get displayed
    correctly.

 -- Fix bug when request comes in for consumable resources and the -c option
    is used in conjunction with -O
 -- Fixed squeue -o "%h" output formatting
 -- Change select/linear message "error: job xxx: best_fit topology failure"
    to debug type.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for sinfo -R to group all midplanes together in a single
    line for midplanes in an error state instead of 1 line for each midplane.
 -- Fix srun to work correctly with --uid when getting an allocation
    and creating a step, also fix salloc to assume identity at the correct
    time as well.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed issue with jobs being refused when running dynamic mode
    and every job on the system happens to be the same size.
 -- Removed bad #define _SLURMD_H from slurmd/get_mach_stat.h.  Didn't appear
    to cause any problems being there, just incorrect syntax.
 -- Validate the job ID when salloc or srun receive an SRUN_JOB_COMPLETE RPC to
    avoid killing the wrong job if the original command exits and the port gets
    re-used by another command right away.
 -- Fix to node in correct state in accounting when updating it to drain from
    scontrol/sview.
 -- BLUEGENE - Removed incorrect unlocking on error cases when starting jobs.
 -- Improve logging of invalid sinfo and squeue print options.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added check to libsched_if to allow root to run even outside of
    SLURM.  This is needed when running certain blocks outside of SLURM in HTC
    mode.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.11-2
===========================
 -- BLUEGENE - make it so libsched_if.so is named correctly on 'L' it is
    libsched_if64.so and on 'P' it is libsched_if.so

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.11
=========================

 -- Fix bug that caused segv when deleting a partition with pending jobs.
 -- Better error message for when trying to modify an account's name with
    sacctmgr.
 -- Added back removal of #include "src/common/slurm_xlator.h" from
    select/cons_res.
 -- Fix incorrect logic in global_accounting in regression tests for
    setting QOS.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed issue where removing a small block in dynamic mode,
    and other blocks also in that midplane needed to be removed and were in
    and error state.  They all weren't removed correctly in accounting.
 -- Prevent scontrol segv with "scontrol show node <name>" command with nodes
    in a hidden partition.
 -- Fixed sizing of popup grids in sview.
 -- Fixed sacct when querying against a jobid the start time is not set.
 -- Fix configure to get correct version of pkg-config if both 32bit and 64bit
    libs are installed.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.10
=========================
 -- Fix memory leak in sched/builtin plugin.
 -- Fixed sbatch to work correctly when no nodes are specified, but
    --ntasks-per-node is.
 -- Make sure account and wckey for a job are lower case before inserting into
    accounting.
 -- Added note to squeue documentation about --jobs option displaying jobs
    even if they are on hidden partitions.
 -- Fix srun to work correctly with --uid when getting an allocation
    and creating a step.
 -- Fix for when removing a limit from a users association inside the
    fairshare tree the parents limit is now inherited automatically in
    the slurmctld.  Previously the slurmctld would have to be restarted.
    This problem only exists when setting a users association limit to -1.
 -- Patch from Matthieu Hautreux (CEA) dealing with possible overflows that
    could come up with the select/cons_res plugin with uint32_t's being treated
    as uint16_t's.
 -- Correct logic for creating a reservation with a Duration=Infinite (used to
    set reservation end time in the past).
 -- Correct logic for creating a reservation that properly handles the OVERLAP
    and IGNORE_JOBS flags (flags were ignored under some conditions).
 -- Fixed a fair-share calculation bug in the priority/multifactor plugin.
 -- Make sure a user entry in the database that was previously deleted is
    restored clean when added back, i.e. remove admin privileges previously
    given.
 -- BLUEGENE - Future start time is set correctly when eligible time for a job
    is in the future, but the job can physically run earlier.
 -- Updated Documentation for sacctmgr for Wall and CPUMin options stating when
    the limit is reached running jobs will be killed.
 -- Fix deadlock issue in the slurmctld when lowering limits in accounting to
    lower than that of pending jobs.

    the --threads-per-core, --cores-per-socket and --sockets-per-node options
    improperly.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res with memory management plus job preemption with
    job removal (e.g. requeue) which under some conditions failed to preempt
    jobs.
 -- Fix deadlock potential when using qos and associations in the slurmctld.
 -- Update documentation to state --ntasks-per-* is for a maximum value
    instead of an absolute.
 -- Get ReturnToService=2 working for front-end configurations (e.g. Cray or
    BlueGene).
 -- Do not make a non-responding node available for use after running
    "scontrol update nodename=<name> state=resume". Wait for node to respond
    before use.
 -- Added slurm_xlator.h to jobacct_gather plugins so they resolve symbols
    correctly when linking to the slurm api.
 -- You can now update a jobs QOS from scontrol.  Previously you could only do
    this from sview.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed bug where if running in non-dynamic mode sometimes the
    start time returned for a job when using test-only would not be correct.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.9
========================
 -- In select/linear - Fix logic to prevent over-subscribing memory with shared
    nodes (Shared=YES or Shared=FORCE).
 -- Fix for handling -N and --ntasks-per-node without specifying -n with
    salloc and sbatch.
 -- Fix jobacct_gather/linux if not polling on tasks to give tasks time to
    start before doing initial gather.
 -- When changing priority with the multifactor plugin we make sure we update
    the last_job_update variable.
 -- Fixed sview for gtk < 2.10 to display correct debug level at first.
 -- Fixed sview to not select too fast when using a mouse right click.
 -- Fixed sacct to display correct timelimits for jobs from accounting.
 -- Fixed sacct when running as root by default query all users as documented.
 -- In proctrack/linuxproc, skip over files in /proc that are not really user
    processes (e.g. "/proc/bus").
 -- Fix documentation bug for slurmdbd.conf
 -- Fix slurmctld to update qos preempt list without restart.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res that in some cases would prevent a preempting job
    from using of resources already allocated to a preemptable running job.
 -- Fix for sreport in interactive mode to honor parsable/2 options.
 -- Fixed minor bugs in sacct and sstat commands
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed issue if the slurmd becomes unresponsive and you have
    blocks in an error state accounting is correct when the slurmd comes
    back up.
 -- Corrected documentation for -n option in srun/salloc/sbatch
 -- BLUEGENE - when running a willrun test along with preemption the bluegene
    plugin now does the correct thing.
 -- Fix possible memory corruption issue which can cause slurmctld to abort.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed small memory leak when setting up env.
 -- Fixed deadlock if using accounting and cluster changes size in the
    database.  This can happen if you mistakenly have multiple primary
    slurmctld's running for a single cluster, which should rarely if ever
    happen.
 -- Fixed sacct -c option.
 -- Critical bug fix in sched/backfill plugin that caused memory corruption.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.8
========================
 -- Update BUILD_NOTES for AIX and bgp systems on how to get sview to
    build correctly.
 -- Update man page for scontrol when nodes are in the "MIXED" state.
 -- Better error messages for sacctmgr.
 -- Fix bug in allocation of CPUs with select/cons_res and --cpus-per-task
    option.
 -- Fix bug in dependency support for afterok and afternotok options to insure
    that the job's exit status gets checked for dependent jobs prior to puring
    completed job records.
 -- Fix bug in sched/backfill that could set an incorrect expected start time
    for a job.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for systems that have midplanes defined in the database
    that don't exist.
 -- Accounting, fixed bug where if removing an object a rollback wasn't
    possible.
 -- Fix possible scontrol stack corruption when listing jobs with very a long
    job or working directory name (over 511 characters).
 -- Insure that SPANK environment variables set by salloc or sbatch get
    propagated to the Prolog on all nodes by setting SLURM_SPANK_* environment
    variables for srun's use.
 -- In sched/wiki2 - Add support for the MODIFYJOB command to alter a job's
    comment field
 -- When a cluster first registers with the SlurmDBD only send nodes in an
    non-usable state.  Before all nodes were sent.
 -- Alter sacct to be able to query jobs by association id.
 -- Edit documentation for scontrol stating ExitCode as something not alterable.
 -- Update documentation about ReturnToService and silently rebooting nodes.
 -- When combining --ntasks-per-node and --exclusive in an allocation request
    the correct thing, giving the allocation the entire node but only
    ntasks-per-node, happens.
 -- Fix accounting transaction logs when deleting associations to put the
    ids instead of the lfts which could change over time.
 -- Fix support for salloc, sbatch and srun's --hint option to avoid allocating
    a job more sockets per node or more cores per socket than desired. Also
    when --hint=compute_bound or --hint=memory_bound then avoid allocating more
    than one task per hyperthread (a change in behavior, but almost certainly
    a preferable mode of operation).

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.7
========================
 -- Modify srun, salloc and sbatch parsing for the --signal option to accept
    either a signal name in addition to the previously supported signal
    numbers (e.g. "--signal=USR2@200").
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed sinfo --long --Node output for cpus on a single cnode.
 -- In sched/wiki2 - Fix another logic bug in support of Moab being able to
    identify preemptable jobs.
 -- In sched/wiki2 - For BlueGene systems only: Fix bug preventing Moab from
    being able to correctly change the node count of pending jobs.
 -- In select/cons_res - Fix bug preventing job preemption with a configuration
    of Shared=FORCE:1 and PreemptMode=GANG,SUSPEND.
 -- In the TaskProlog, add support for an "unset" option to clear environment
    variables for the user application. Also add support for embedded white-
    space in the environment variables exported to the user application
    (everything after the equal sign to the end of the line is included without
    alteration).
 -- Do not install /etc/init.d/slurm or /etc/init.d/slurmdbd on AIX systems.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed check for small blocks if a node card of a midplane is
    in an error state other jobs can still run on the midplane on other
    nodecards.
 -- BLUEGENE - Check to make sure job killing is in the active job table in
    DB2 when killing the job.
 -- Correct logic to support ResvOverRun configuration parameter.
 -- Get --acctg-freq option working for srun and salloc commands.
 -- Fix sinfo display of drained nodes correctly with the summarize flag.
 -- Fix minor memory leaks in slurmd and slurmstepd.
 -- Better error messages for failed step launch.
 -- Modify srun to insure compatability of the --relative option with the node
    count requested.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.6-2
==========================
 -- In sched/wiki2 - Fix logic in support of Moab being able to identify
    preemptable jobs.
 -- Applied fixes to a debug4 message in priority_multifactor.c sent in by
    Per Lundqvist
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed issue where incorrect nodecards could be picked when
    looking at combining small blocks to make a larger small block.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.6
========================
 -- For newly submitted jobs, report expected start time in squeue --start as
    "N/A" rather than current time.
 -- Correct sched/backfill logic so that it runs in a more timely fashion.
 -- Fixed issue if running on accounting cache and priority/multifactor to
    initialize the root association when the database comes back up.
 -- Emulated BLUEGENE - fixed issue where blocks weren't always created
    correctly when loading from state.  This does not apply to a real
    bluegene system, only emulated.
 -- Fixed bug when job is completing and its cpu_cnt would be calculated
    incorrectly, possibly resulting in an underflow being logged.
 -- Fixed bug where if there are pending jobs in a partition which was
    updated to have no nodes in it the slurmctld would dump core.
 -- Fixed smap and sview to display partitions with no nodes in them.
 -- Improve configure script's logic to detect LUA libraries.
 -- Fix bug that could cause slurmctld to abort if select/cons_res is used AND a
    job is submitted using the --no-kill option AND one of the job's nodes goes
    DOWN AND slurmctld restarts while that job is still running.
 -- In jobcomp plugins, job time limit was sometimes recorded improperly if not
    set by user (recorded huge number rather than partition's time limit).

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.5
========================
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed display of draining nodes for sinfo -R.
 -- Fixes to scontrol and sview when setting a job to an impossible start time.
 -- Added -h to srun for help.
 -- Fix for sacctmgr man page to remove erroneous 'with' statements.
 -- Fix for unpacking jobs with accounting statistics, previously it appears
    only steps were unpacked correctly, for the most case sacct would only
    display this information making this fix a very minor one.
 -- Changed scontrol and sview output for jobs with unknown end times from
    'NONE' to 'Unknown'.
 -- Fixed mysql plugin to reset classification when adding a
    previously deleted cluster.
 -- Permit a batch script to reset umask and have that propagate to tasks
    spawed by subsequent srun. Previously the umask in effect when sbatch was
    executed was propagated to tasks spawed by srun.
 -- Modify slurm_job_cpus_allocated_on_node_id() and
    slurm_job_cpus_allocated_on_node() functions to not write explanation of
    failures to stderr. Only return -1 and set errno.
 -- Correction in configurator.html script. Prolog and Epilog were reversed.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed race condition where if a nodecard has an error on an
    un-booted block when a job comes to use it before the state checking
    thread notices it which could cause the slurmctld to lock up on a
    non-dynamic system.
 -- In select/cons_res with FastSchedule=0 and Procs=# defined for the node,
    but no specific socket/core/thread count configured, avoid fatal error if
    the number of cores on a node is less than the number of Procs configured.
 -- Added ability for the perlapi to utilize opaque data types returned from
    the C api.
 -- BLUEGENE - made the perlapi get correct values for cpus per node,
    Previously it would give the number of cpus per cnode instead of midplane.
 -- BLEUGENE - Fixed issue where if a block being selected for a job to use
    and during the process a hardware failure happens, previously the block
    would still be allowed to be used which would fail or requeue the job
    depending on the configuration.
 -- For SPANK job environment, avoid duplicate "SPANK_" prefix for environment
    set by sbatch jobs.
 -- Make squeue select jobs on hidden partitions when requesting more than one.
 -- Avoid automatically cancelling job steps when all of the tasks on some node
    have gracefully terminated.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.4
========================
 -- Fix for purge script in accounting to use correct options.
 -- If SelectType=select/linear and SelectTypeParameters=CR_Memory fix bug that
    would fail to release memory reserved for a job if "scontrol reconfigure"
    is executed while the job is in completing state.
 -- Fix bug in handling event trigger for job time limit while job is still
    in pending state.
 -- Fixed display of Ave/MaxCPU in sacct for jobs. Steps were printed
    correctly.
 -- When node current features differs from slurm.conf, log the node names
    using a hostlist expression rather than listing individual node names.
 -- Improve ability of srun to abort job step for some task launch failures.
 -- Fix mvapich plugin logic to release the created job allocation on
    initialization failure (previously the failures would cancel job step,
    but retain job allocation).
 -- Fix bug in srun for task count so large that it overflows int data type.
 -- Fix important bug in select/cons_res handling of ntasks-per-core parameter
    that was uncovered by a bug fixed in v2.1.3. Bug produced fatal error for
    slurmctld: "cons_res: cpus computation error".
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res handling of partitions configured with
    Shared=YES. Prior logic failed to support running multiple jobs per node.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.3-2
==========================
 -- Modified spec file to obsolete pam_slurm when installing
    the slurm-pam_slurm rpm.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.3-1
==========================
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix issues on static/overlap systems where if a midplane
    was drained you would not be able to create new blocks on it.
 -- In sched/wiki2 (for Moab): Add excluded host list to job information
    using new keyword "EXCLUDE_HOSTLIST".
 -- Correct slurmd reporting of incorrect socket/core/thread counts.
 -- For sched/wiki2 (Moab): Do not extend a job's end time for suspend/resume
    or startup delay due to node boot time. A job's end time will always be
    its start time plus time limit.
 -- Added build-time option (to configure program) of --with-pam_dir to
    specify the directory into which PAM modules get installed, although it
    should pick the proper directory by default. "make install" and "rpmbuild"
    should now put the pam_slurm.so file in the proper directory.
 -- Modify PAM module to link against SLURM API shared library and use exported
    slurm_hostlist functions.
 -- Do not block new jobs with --immediate option while another job is in the
    process of being requeued (which can take a long time for some node failure
    modes).
 -- For topology/tree, log invalid hostnames in a single hostlist expression
    rather than one per line.
 -- A job step's default time limit will be UNLIMITED rather than partition's
    default time limit. The step will automatically be cancelled as part of the
    job termination logic when the job's time limit is reached.
 -- sacct - fixed bug when checking jobs against a reservation
 -- In select/cons_res, fix support for job allocation with --ntasks_per_node
    option. Previously could allocate too few CPUs on some nodes.
 -- Adjustment made to init message to the slurmdbd to allow backwards
    compatibility with future 2.2 release. YOU NEED TO UPGRADE SLURMDBD
    BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.
 -- Fix accounting when comment of down/drained node has double quotes in it.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.2
========================
 -- Added nodelist to sview for jobs on non-bluegene systems
 -- Correction in value of batch job environment variable SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE
    under some conditions.
 -- When a node silently fails which is already drained/down the reason
    for draining for the node is not changed.
 -- Srun will ignore SLURM_NNODES environment variable and use the count of
    currently allocated nodes if that count changes during the job's lifetime
    (e.g. job allocation uses the --no-kill option and a node goes DOWN, job
    step would previously always fail).
 -- Made it so sacctmgr can't add blank user or account.  The MySQL plugin
    will also reject such requests.
 -- Revert libpmi.so version for compatibility with SLURM version 2.0 and
    earlier to avoid forcing applications using a specific libpmi.so version to
    rebuild unnecessarily (revert from libpmi.so.21.0.0 to libpmi.so.0.0.0).
 -- Restore support for a pending job's constraints (required node features)
    when slurmctld is restarted (internal structure needed to be rebuilt).
 -- Removed checkpoint_blcr.so from the plugin rpm in the slurm.spec since
    it is also in the blcr rpm.
 -- Fixed issue in sview where you were unable to edit the count
    of jobs to share resources.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fixed issue where tasks on steps weren't being displayed
    correctly with scontrol and sview.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed wiki2 plugin to report correct task count for pending
    jobs.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added /etc/ld.so.conf.d/slurm.conf to point to the
    directory holding libsched_if64.so when building rpms.
 -- Adjust get_wckeys call in slurmdbd to allow operators to list wckeys.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.1
========================
 -- Fix for case sensitive databases when a slurmctld has a mixed case
    clustername to lower case the string to easy compares.
 -- Fix squeue if job is completing and failed to print remaining
    nodes instead of failed message.
 -- Fix sview core when searching for partitions by state.
 -- Fixed setting the start time when querying in sacct to the
    beginning of the day if not set previously.
 -- Defined slurm_free_reservation_info_msg and slurm_free_topo_info_msg
    in common/slurm_protocol_defs.h
 -- Avoid generating error when a job step includes a memory specification and
    memory is not configured as a consumable resource.
 -- Patch for small memory leak in src/common/plugstack.c
 -- Fix sview search on node state.
 -- Fix bug in which improperly formed job dependency specification can cause
    slurmctld to abort.
 -- Fixed issue where slurmctld wouldn't always get a message to send cluster
    information when registering for the first time with the slurmdbd.
 -- Add slurm_*_trigger.3 man pages for event trigger APIs.
 -- Fix bug in job preemption logic that would free allocated memory twice.
 -- Fix spelling issues (from Gennaro Oliva)
 -- Fix issue when changing parents of an account in accounting all childern
    weren't always sent to their respected slurmctlds until a restart.
 -- Restore support for srun/salloc/sbatch option --hint=nomultithread to
    bind tasks to cores rather than threads (broken in slurm v2.1.0-pre5).
 -- Fix issue where a 2.0 sacct could not talk correctly to a 2.1 slurmdbd.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix issue where no partitions have any nodes assigned them to
    alert user no blocks can be created.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix smap to put BGP images when using -Dc on a Blue Gene/P
    system.
 -- Set SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR environment variable for srun and salloc commands to
    match behavior of sbatch command.
 -- Report WorkDir from "scontrol show job" command for jobs launched using
    salloc and srun.
 -- Update correctly the wckey when changing it on a pending job.
 -- Set wckeyid correctly in accounting when cancelling a pending job.
 -- BLUEGENE - critical fix where jobs would be killed incorrectly.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix for sview putting multiple ionodes on to nodelists when
    viewing the jobs tab.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.0
========================
 -- Improve sview layout of blocks in use.
 -- A user can now change the dimensions of the grid in sview.
 -- BLUEGENE - improved startup speed further for large numbers of defined
    blocks
 -- Fix to _get_job_min_nodes() in wiki2/get_jobs.c suggested by Michal Novotny
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed issues when updating a pending job when a node
    count was incorrect for the asked for connection type.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed issue when combining blocks that are in ready states to
    make a larger block from those or make multiple smaller blocks by
    splitting the larger block.  Previously this would only work with block
    in a free state.
 -- Fix bug in wiki(2) plugins where if HostFormat=2 and the task list is
    greater than 64 we don't truncate.  Previously this would mess up Moab
    by sending a truncated task list when doing a get jobs.
 -- Added update slurmctld debug level to sview when in admin mode.
 -- Added logic to make sure if enforcing a memory limit when using the
    jobacct_gather plugin a user can no longer turn off the logic to enforce
    the limit.
 -- Replaced many calls to getpwuid() with reentrant uid_to_string()
 -- The slurmstepd will now refresh it's log file handle on a reconfig,
    previously if a log was rolled any output from the stepd was lost.
