<h1>Accounting and Resource Limits</h1>

<p>Slurm can be configured to collect accounting information for every
job and job step executed.
Accounting records can be written to a simple text file or a database.
Information is available about both currently executing jobs and
jobs which have already terminated.
The <b>sacct</b> command can report resource usage for running or terminated
jobs including individual tasks, which can be useful to detect load imbalance
between the tasks.
The <b>sstat</b> command can be used to status only currently running jobs.
It also can give you valuable information about imbalance between tasks.
The <b>sreport</b> can be used to generate reports based upon all jobs
executed in a particular time interval.</p>

<p>There are three distinct plugin types associated with resource accounting.
The Slurm configuration parameters (in <i>slurm.conf</i>) associated with
these plugins include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>AccountingStorageType</b> controls how detailed job and job
step information is recorded. You can store this information in a
text file, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
or MariaDB database (using the InnoDB storage engine), optionally using SlurmDBD for added security.</li>
<li><b>JobAcctGatherType</b> is operating system dependent and
controls what mechanism is used to collect accounting information.
Supported values are <i>jobacct_gather/linux</i>
and <i>jobacct_gather/none</i> (no information collected).</li>
<li><b>JobCompType</b> controls how job completion information is
recorded. This can be used to record basic job information such
as job name, user name, allocated nodes, start time, completion
time, exit status, etc. If the preservation of only basic job
information is required, this plugin should satisfy your needs
with minimal overhead. You can store this information in a text file,
or <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or MariaDB database.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of sacct to view information about jobs
is dependent upon AccountingStorageType
being configured to collect and store that information.
The use of sreport is dependent upon some database being
used to store that information.</p>

<p>The use of sacct or sstat to view information about resource usage
  within jobs is dependent upon both JobAcctGatherType and AccountingStorageType
  being configured to collect and store that information.</p>

<p>Storing the accounting information into text files is
very simple. Just configure the appropriate plugin (e.g.
<i>AccountingStorageType=accounting_storage/filetxt</i> and/or
<i>JobCompType=jobcomp/filetxt</i>) and then specify the
pathname of the file (e.g.
<i>AccountingStorageLoc=/var/log/slurm/accounting</i> and/or
<i>JobCompLoc=/var/log/slurm/job_completions</i>).
Use the <i>logrotate</i> or similar tool to prevent the
log files from getting too large.
Send a SIGHUP signal to the <i>slurmctld</i> daemon
after moving the files, but before compressing them so
that new log files will be created.</p>

<p>Storing the data directly into a database from Slurm may seem
attractive, but it requires the availability of user name and
password data not only for the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld),
but also for user commands which need to access the data (sacct, sreport, and
sacctmgr).
Making potentially sensitive information available to all users makes
database security more difficult to provide. Sending the data through
an intermediate daemon can provide better security and performance
(through caching data). SlurmDBD (Slurm Database Daemon) provides such services.
SlurmDBD is written in C, multi-threaded, secure and fast.
The configuration required to use SlurmDBD will be described below.
Storing information directly into a database would be similar.</p>

<p>Note that SlurmDBD relies upon existing Slurm plugins
for authentication and Slurm sql for database use, but the other Slurm
commands and daemons are not required on the host where
SlurmDBD is installed. Install the <i>slurmdbd</i>,
<i>slurm-plugins</i>, and <i>slurm-sql</i> RPMs on the computer when SlurmDBD
is to execute.  If you want munge authentication, which is highly
recommended, you will also need to install
the <i>slurm-munge</i> RPM.</p>

<p>Note if you switch from using the MySQL plugin to use the SlurmDBD plugin
  you must make sure the cluster has been added to the database.  The MySQL
  plugin doesn't require this, but also will not hurt things if you have it
  there when using the MySQL plugin.  You can verify with
<pre>
sacctmgr list cluster
</pre>
If the cluster isn't there add it (where my clusters name were snowflake):
<pre>
sacctmgr add cluster snowflake
</pre>
Failure to do so will result in the slurmctld failing to talk to the slurmdbd
after the switch.  If you plan to upgrade to a new version of Slurm don't switch
plugins at the same time or you may get unexpected results.  Do one then the
other.</p>

<p>If SlurmDBD is configured for use but not responding then <i>slurmctld</i> 
will utilize an interal cache until SlurmDBD is returned to service.
The cached data is written by <i>slurmctld</i> to local storage upon shutdown
and recovered at startup.
If SlurmDBD is not available when <i>slurmctld</i> starts, a cache of 
valid bank accounts, user limits, etc. based upon their state when the 
daemons were last communicating will be used. 
Note that SlurmDBD must be responding when <i>slurmctld</i> is first started
since no cache of this critical data will be available.
Job and step accounting records generated by <i>slurmctld</i> will be 
written to a cache as needed and transferred to SlurmDBD when returned to 
service.</p> 

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<p>With the SlurmDBD, we are able to collect data from multiple
clusters in a single location.
This does impose some constraints on the user naming and IDs.
Accounting is maintained by user name (not user ID), but a
given user name should refer to the same person across all
of the computers.
Authentication relies upon user ID numbers, so those must
be uniform across all computers communicating with each
SlurmDBD, at least for users requiring authentication.
In particular, the configured <i>SlurmUser</i> must have the
same name and ID across all clusters.
If you plan to have administrators of user accounts, limits,
etc. they must also have consistent names and IDs across all
clusters.
If you plan to restrict access to accounting records (e.g.
only permit a user to view records of his jobs), then all
users should have consistent names and IDs.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Only lowercase usernames are supported.

<p>The best way to insure security of the data is by authenticating
communications to the SlurmDBD and we recommend
<a href="https://dun.github.io/munge/">MUNGE</a> for that purpose.
If you have one cluster managed by Slurm and execute the SlurmDBD
on that one cluster, the normal MUNGE configuration will suffice.
Otherwise MUNGE should then be installed on all nodes of all
Slurm managed clusters, plus the machine where SlurmDBD executes.
You then have a choice of either having a single MUNGE key for
all of these computers or maintaining a unique key for each of the
clusters plus a second key for communications between the clusters
for better security.
MUNGE enhancements are planned to support two keys within a single
configuration file, but presently two different daemons must be
started with different configurations to support two different keys
(create two key files and start the daemons with the
<i>--key-file</i> option to locate the proper key plus the
<i>--socket</i> option to specify distinct local domain sockets for each).
The pathname of local domain socket will be needed in the Slurm
and SlurmDBD configuration files (slurm.conf and slurmdbd.conf
respectively, more details are provided below).</p>

<p>Whether you use any authentication module or not you will need to have
a way for the SlurmDBD to get uid's for users and/or admin.  If using
MUNGE, it is ideal for your users to have the same id on all your
clusters.  If this is the case you should have a combination of every clusters
/etc/passwd file on the database server to allow the DBD to resolve
names for authentication.  If using MUNGE and a users name is not in
the passwd file the action will fail.  If not using MUNGE, you should
add anyone you want to be an administrator or operator to the passwd file.
If they plan on running sacctmgr or any of the accounting tools they
should have the same uid, or they will not authentic correctly.  An
LDAP server could also server as a way to gather this information.</p>

<h2>Slurm JobComp Configuration</h2>

<p>Presently job completion is not supported with the SlurmDBD, but can be
written directly to a database, script or flat file. If you are
running with the accounting storage plugin, use of the job completion plugin
is probably redundant. If you would like to configure this, some of the more
important parameters include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>JobCompHost</b>:
Only needed if using a database. The name or address of the host where
the database server executes.</li>

<li><b>JobCompPass</b>:
Only needed if using a database. Password for the user connecting to
the database. Since the password can not be security maintained,
storing the information directly in a database is not recommended.</li>

<li><b>JobCompPort</b>:
Only needed if using a database. The network port that the database
accepts communication on.</li>

<li><b>JobCompType</b>:
Type of jobcomp plugin set to "jobcomp/mysql" or "jobcomp/filetxt".</li>

<li><b>JobCompUser</b>:
Only needed if using a database. User name to connect to
the database with.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Slurm Accounting Configuration Before Build</h2>

<p>While the SlurmDBD will work with a flat text file for recording
job completions and such this configuration will not allow
"associations" between a user and account. A database allows such
a configuration.

<p><b>MySQL or MariaDB is the preferred database.</b>
To enable this database support
one only needs to have the development package for the database they
wish to use on the system. <b>Slurm uses the InnoDB storage
engine in MySQL to make rollback possible.  This must be available on your
MySQL installation or rollback will not work.</b>
</p><p>The slurm configure
script uses mysql_config to find out the information it needs
about installed libraries and headers. You can specify where your
mysql_config script is with the
</i>--with-mysql_conf=/path/to/mysql_config</i> option when configuring your
slurm build.
On a successful configure, output is something like this: </p>
<pre>
checking for mysql_config... /usr/bin/mysql_config
MySQL test program built properly.
</pre>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Before running the slurmdbd for the first time, review the
current setting for MySQL's
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-parameters.html
#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size">innodb_buffer_pool_size</a>.
Consider setting this
value large enough to handle the size of the database. This helps when
converting large tables over to the new database schema and when purging
old records. Setting innodb_lock_wait_timeout and innodb_log_file_size to
larger values than the default is also recommended.</p>

<p>
ex.
<pre>
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_buffer_pool_size';
+-------------------------+-----------+
| Variable_name           | Value     |
+-------------------------+-----------+
| innodb_buffer_pool_size | 134217728 |
+-------------------------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

$cat my.cnf
...
[mysqld]
<i>innodb_buffer_pool_size=1024M</i>
<i>innodb_log_file_size=64M</i>
<i>innodb_lock_wait_timeout=900</i>
...
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Slurm Accounting Configuration After Build</h2>

<p>For simplicity sake we are going to reference everything as if you
are running with the SlurmDBD. You can communicate with a storage plugin
directly, but that offers minimal security. </p>

<p>Several Slurm configuration parameters must be set to support
archiving information in SlurmDBD. SlurmDBD has a separate configuration
file which is documented in a separate section.
Note that you can write accounting information to SlurmDBD
while job completion records are written to a text file or
not maintained at all.
If you don't set the configuration parameters that begin
with "AccountingStorage" then accounting information will not be
referenced or recorded.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>AccountingStorageEnforce</b>:
This option contains a comma separated list of options you may want to
 enforce.  The valid options are any comma separated combination of
<ul>
<li>associations - This will prevent users from running jobs if
their <i>association</i> is not in the database. This option will
prevent users from accessing invalid accounts.
</li>
<li>limits - This will enforce limits set on associations and qos'.
  By setting this option, the
  'associations' option is automatically set.  If a qos is used the
  limits will be enforced, but 'qos' described below is still needed
  if you want to enforce access to the qos.
</li>
<li>nojobs - This will make it so no job information is stored in
  accounting.  By setting this 'nosteps' is also set.
</li>
<li>nosteps - This will make it so no step information is stored in
  accounting. Both nojobs and nosteps could be helpful in an
  environment where you want to use limits but don't really care about
  utilization.
</li>
<li>qos - This will require all jobs to specify (either overtly or by
  default) a valid qos (Quality of Service).  QOS values are defined for
  each association in the database.  By setting this option, the
  'associations' option is automatically set.  If you want QOS limits to be
  enforced you need to use the 'limits' option.
</li>
<li>safe - This will ensure a job will only be launched when using an
  association or qos that has a GrpTRESMins limit set if the job will be
  able to run to completion. Without this option set, jobs will be
  launched as long as their usage hasn't reached the TRES-minutes limit
  which can lead to jobs being launched but then killed when the limit is
  reached. By setting this option, both the 'associations' option and the
  'limits' option are set automatically.
</li>
<li>wckeys - This will prevent users from running jobs under a wckey
  that they don't have access to.  By using this option, the
  'associations' option is automatically set.  The 'TrackWCKey' option is also
  set to true.
</li>
</ul>
(NOTE: The association is a combination of cluster, account,
user names and optional partition name.)
<br>
<b>Without AccountingStorageEnforce being set (the default behavior)
jobs will be executed based upon policies configured in Slurm on each
cluster.</b>
</li>

<li><b>AccountingStorageHost</b>: The name or address of the host where
SlurmDBD executes</li>

<li><b>AccountingStoragePass</b>: If using SlurmDBD with a second MUNGE
daemon, store the pathname of the named socket used by MUNGE to provide
enterprise-wide authentication (i.e. /var/run/munge/moab.socket.2). Otherwise
the default MUNGE daemon will be used. </li>

<li><b>AccountingStoragePort</b>:
The network port that SlurmDBD accepts communication on.</li>

<li><b>AccountingStorageType</b>:
Set to "accounting_storage/slurmdbd".</li>

<li><b>ClusterName</b>:
Set to a unique name for each Slurm-managed cluster so that
accounting records from each can be identified.</li>
<li><b>TrackWCKey</b>:
Boolean.  If you want to track wckeys (Workload Characterization Key)
  of users.  A Wckey is an orthogonal way to do accounting against possibly
  unrelated accounts. When a job is run, use the --wckey option to specify a
  value and accounting records will be collected by this wckey.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>SlurmDBD Configuration</h2>

<p>SlurmDBD requires its own configuration file called "slurmdbd.conf".
This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and
should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g. "slurm").
This file should be protected from unauthorized access since it
contains a database login name and password.
See "man slurmdbd.conf" for a more complete description of the
configuration parameters.
Some of the more important parameters include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>AuthInfo</b>:
If using SlurmDBD with a second MUNGE daemon, store the pathname of
the named socket used by MUNGE to provide enterprise-wide.
Otherwise the default MUNGE daemon will be used.</li>

<li><b>AuthType</b>:
Define the authentication method for communications between Slurm
components. A value of "auth/munge" is recommended.</li>

<li><b>DbdHost</b>:
The name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is executed.
This should be a node name without the full domain name (e.g. "lx0001").
This defaults to <i>localhost</i> but should be supplied to avoid a
warning message.</li>

<li><b>DbdPort</b>:
The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens
to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system
build time. If none is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.
This value must be equal to the <i>AccountingStoragePort</i> parameter in the
slurm.conf file.</li>

<li><b>LogFile</b>:
Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon's
logs are written.
The default value is none (performs logging via syslog).</li>

<li><b>PluginDir</b>:
Identifies the places in which to look for Slurm plugins.
This is a colon-separated list of directories, like the PATH
environment variable.
The default value is the prefix given at configure time + "/lib/slurm".</li>

<li><b>SlurmUser</b>:
The name of the user that the <i>slurmctld</i> daemon executes as.
This user must exist on the machine executing the Slurm Database Daemon
and have the same user ID as the hosts on which <i>slurmctld</i> execute.
For security purposes, a user other than "root" is recommended.
The default value is "root". This name should also be the same SlurmUser
on all clusters reporting to the SlurmDBD.</li>

<li><b>StorageHost</b>:
Define the name of the host the database is running where we are going
to store the data.
Ideally this should be the host on which SlurmDBD executes. But could
be a different machine.</li>

<li><b>StorageLoc</b>:
Specifies the name of the database where accounting
records are written. For databases the default database is
slurm_acct_db. Note the name can not have a '/' in it or the
default will be used.</li>

<li><b>StoragePass</b>:
Define the password used to gain access to the database to store
the job accounting data.</li>

<li><b>StoragePort</b>:
Define the port on which the database is listening.</li>

<li><b>StorageType</b>:
Define the accounting storage mechanism is.
The only acceptable value at present is "accounting_storage/mysql".
The value "accounting_storage/mysql" indicates that accounting records
should be written to a MySQL or MariaDB database specified by the
<i>StorageLoc</i> parameter.
This value must be specified.</li>

<li><b>StorageUser</b>:
Define the name of the user we are going to connect to the database
with to store the job accounting data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MySQL Configuration</h2>

<p>While Slurm will create the database tables automatically you will need to
make sure the StorageUser is given permissions in the MySQL or MariaDB database
to do so.
As the <i>mysql</i> user grant privileges to that user using a
command such as:</p>

<p>GRANT ALL ON StorageLoc.* TO 'StorageUser'@'StorageHost';<br>
(The ticks are needed)</p>

<p>(You need to be root to do this. Also in the info for password
usage there is a line that starts with '->'. This a continuation
prompt since the previous mysql statement did not end with a ';'. It
assumes that you wish to input more info.)</p>

<p>If you want Slurm to create the database itself, and any future databases,
you can change your grant line to be *.* instead of StorageLoc.*</p>

<p>Live example:</p>

<pre>
mysql@snowflake:~$ mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 538
Server version: 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.1 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create user 'slurm'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
</pre>

<p>You may also need to do the same with the system name in order
for mysql to work correctly:</p>
<pre>
mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'system0';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
where 'system0' is the localhost or database storage host.
</pre>
<p>or with a password...</p>
<pre>
mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'localhost'
    -> identified by 'some_pass' with grant option;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
</pre>

<p>The same is true in the case, you made to do the same with the 
system name:</p>
<pre>
mysql> grant all on slurm_acct_db.* TO 'slurm'@'system0'
    -> identified by 'some_pass' with grant option;
where 'system0' is the localhost or database storage host.
</pre>

<p>Verify you have InnoDB support</p>
<pre>
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_innodb';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| have_innodb   | YES   |
+---------------+-------+
</pre>

<p>Then create the database:</p>
<pre>
mysql> create database slurm_acct_db;
</pre>

<p>This will grant user 'slurm' access to do what it needs to do on the local
host or the storage host system.  This must be done before the SlurmDBD will
work properly. After you grant permission to the user 'slurm' in mysql then
you can start SlurmDBD and the other Slurm daemons. You start SlurmDBD by
typing its pathname '/usr/sbin/slurmdbd' or '/etc/init.d/slurmdbd start'. You
can verify that SlurmDBD is running by typing 'ps aux | grep
slurmdbd'.

<p>If the SlurmDBD is not running you can
use the -v option when you start SlurmDBD to get more detailed
information.  Starting the SlurmDBD in daemon mode with the '-D' option can
also help in debugging so you don't have to go to the log to find the
problem.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>There are a few tools available to work with accounting data,
<b>sacct</b>, <b>sacctmgr</b>, and <b>sreport</b>.
These tools all get or set data through the SlurmDBD daemon.
<ul>
<li><b>sacct</b> is used to generate accounting report for both
running and completed jobs.</li>
<li><b>sacctmgr</b> is used to manage associations in the database:
add or remove clusters, add or remove users, etc.</li>
<li><b>sreport</b> is used to generate various reports on usage collected over a
given time period.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the man pages for each command for more information.</p>

<h2>Database Configuration</h2>

<p>Accounting records are maintained based upon what we refer
to as an <i>Association</i>,
which consists of four elements: cluster, account, user names and
an optional partition name. Use the <i>sacctmgr</i>
command to create and manage these records.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> There is an order to set up accounting associations.
You must define clusters before you add accounts and you must add accounts
before you can add users.</p>

<p>For example, to add a cluster named "snowflake" to the database
execute this line:</p>
<pre>
sacctmgr add cluster snowflake
</pre>

<p>Add accounts "none" and "test" to cluster "snowflake" with an execute
line of this sort:</p>
<pre>
sacctmgr add account none,test Cluster=snowflake \
  Description="none" Organization="none"
</pre>

<p>If you have more clusters you want to add these accounts, to you
can either not specify a cluster, which will add the accounts to all
clusters in the system, or comma separate the cluster names you want
to add to in the cluster option.
Note that multiple accounts can be added at the same time
by comma separating the names.
A <i>description</i> of the account and the <i>organization</i> which
it belongs to must be specified.
These terms can be used later to generated accounting reports.
Accounts may be arranged in a hierarchical fashion, for example accounts
<i>chemistry</i> and <i>physics</i> may be children of the account <i>science</i>.
The hierarchy may have an arbitrary depth.
Just specify the <i>parent=''</i> option in the add account line to construct
the hierarchy.
For the example above execute</p>
<pre>
sacctmgr add account science \
 Description="science accounts" Organization=science
sacctmgr add account chemistry,physics parent=science \
 Description="physical sciences" Organization=science
</pre>

<p>Add users to accounts using similar syntax.
For example, to permit user <i>da</i> to execute jobs on all clusters
with a default account of <i>test</i> execute:</p>
<pre>
sacctmgr add user brian Account=physics
sacctmgr add user da DefaultAccount=test
</pre>

<p>If <b>AccountingStorageEnforce=associations</b> is configured in
the slurm.conf of the cluster <i>snowflake</i> then user <i>da</i> would be
allowed to run in account <i>test</i> and any other accounts added
in the future.
Any attempt to use other accounts will result in the job being
aborted.
Account <i>test</i> will be the default if he doesn't specify one in
the job submission command.</p>

<p>Partition names can also be added to an "add user" command with the
Partition='partitionname' option to specify an association specific to
a slurm partition.</p>

<h2>Cluster Options</h2>

<p>When either adding or modifying a cluster, these are the options
available with sacctmgr:
<ul>
<li><b>Name=</b> Cluster name</li>

</ul>

<h2>Account Options</h2>

<p>When either adding or modifying an account, the following sacctmgr
options are available:
<ul>
<li><b>Cluster=</b> Only add this account to these clusters.
The account is added to all defined clusters by default.</li>

<li><b>Description=</b> Description of the account. (Default is
  account name)</li>

<li><b>Name=</b> Name of account. Note the name must be unique and can not
represent different bank accounts at different points in the account
hierarchy</li>

<li><b>Organization=</b>Organization of the account. (Default is
  parent account unless parent account is root then organization is
  set to the account name.)</li>

<li><b>Parent=</b> Make this account a child of this other account
  (already added).</li>

</ul>

<h2>User Options</h2>

<p>When either adding or modifying a user, the following sacctmgr
options are available:

<ul>
<li><b>Account=</b> Account(s) to add user to</li>

<li><b>AdminLevel=</b> This field is used to allow a user to add accounting
privileges to this user. Valid options are
<ul>
<li>None</li>
<li>Operator: can add, modify, and remove any database object (user,
account, etc), and add other operators
<br>On a SlurmDBD served slurmctld these users can<br>
<ul>
<li>View information that is blocked to regular uses by a PrivateData
  flag</li>
<li>Create/Alter/Delete Reservations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Admin: These users have the same level of privileges as an
operator in the database.  They can also alter anything on a served
slurmctld as if they were the slurm user or root.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Cluster=</b> Only add to accounts on these clusters (default is all clusters)</li>

<li><b>DefaultAccount=</b> Default account for the user, used when no account
is specified when a job is submitted. (Required on creation)</li>

<li><b>DefaultWCKey=</b> Default wckey for the user, used when no wckey
is specified when a job is submitted. (Only used when tracking wckeys.)</li>

<li><b>Name=</b> User name</li>

<li><b>Partition=</b> Name of Slurm partition this association applies to</li>

</ul>

<h2>Limit Enforcement</h2>

<p>Various limits and limit enforcement are described in
  the <a href="resource_limits.html">Resource Limits</a> web page.</p>

<p>To enable any limit enforcement you must at least have
<b>AccountingStorageEnforce=limits</b> in your slurm.conf,
otherwise, even if you have limits set, they will not be enforced.
Other options for AccountingStorageEnforce and the explanation for
each are found on the <a href="resource_limits.html">Resource
Limits</a> document.</p>

<h2>Modifying Entities</h2>

<p>When modifying entities, you can specify many different options in
SQL-like fashion, using key words like <i>where</i> and <i>set</i>.
A typical execute line has the following form:
<pre>
sacctmgr modify &lt;entity&gt; set &lt;options&gt; where &lt;options&gt;
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
sacctmgr modify user set default=none where default=test
</pre>
<p>will change all users with a default account of "test" to account "none".
Once an entity has been added, modified or removed, the change is
sent to the appropriate Slurm daemons and will be available for use
instantly.</p>

<h2>Removing Entities</h2>

<p>Removing entities using an execute line similar to the modify example above,
but without the set options.
For example, remove all users with a default account "test" using the following
execute line:</p>
<pre>
sacctmgr remove user where default=test
</pre>
<p>will remove all user records where the default account is "test".</p>

<pre>
sacctmgr remove user brian where account=physics
</pre>
<p>will remove user "brian" from account "physics". If user "brian" has
access to other accounts, those user records will remain.</p>

as deleted.
If an entity has existed for less than 1 day, the entity will be removed
completely. This is meant to clean up after typographic errors.</p>
