<h1>Quick Start User Guide</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system
for large and small Linux clusters. SLURM requires no kernel modifications for
its operation and is relatively self-contained. As a cluster workload manager,
SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive
access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they
can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and
monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally,
it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>As depicted in Figure 1, SLURM consists of a <b>slurmd</b> daemon running on
each compute node and a central <b>slurmctld</b> daemon running on a management node
(with optional fail-over twin).
The <b>slurmd</b> daemons provide fault-tolerant hierarchical communications.
The user commands include: <b>sacct</b>, <b>salloc</b>, <b>sattach</b>,
<b>sbatch</b>, <b>sbcast</b>, <b>scancel</b>, <b>scontrol</b>,
<b>sinfo</b>, <b>smap</b>, <b>squeue</b>, <b>srun</b>, <b>strigger</b>
and <b>sview</b>.
All of the commands can run anywhere in the cluster.</p>

<p>The entities managed by these SLURM daemons, shown in Figure 2, include
<b>nodes</b>, the compute resource in SLURM,
<b>partitions</b>, which group nodes into logical (possibly overlapping) sets,
<b>jobs</b>, or allocations of resources assigned to a user for
a specified amount of time, and
<b>job steps</b>, which are sets of (possibly parallel) tasks within a job.
The partitions can be considered job queues, each of which has an assortment of
constraints such as job size limit, job time limit, users permitted to use it, etc.
Priority-ordered jobs are allocated nodes within a partition until the resources
(nodes, processors, memory, etc.) within that partition are exhausted. Once
a job is assigned a set of nodes, the user is able to initiate parallel work in
the form of job steps in any configuration within the allocation. For instance,
a single job step may be started that utilizes all nodes allocated to the job,
or several job steps may independently use a portion of the allocation.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>Man pages exist for all SLURM daemons, commands, and API functions. The command
option <span class="commandline">--help</span> also provides a brief summary of
options. Note that the command options are all case sensitive.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sacct</b></span> is used to report job or job
step accounting information about active or completed jobs.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>salloc</b></span> is used to allocate resources
for a job in real time. Typically this is used to allocate resources and spawn a shell.
The shell is then used to execute srun commands to launch parallel tasks.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sattach</b></span> is used to attach standard
input, output, and error plus signal capabilities to a currently running
job or job step. One can attach to and detach from jobs multiple times.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sbatch</b></span> is used to submit a job script
for later execution. The script will typically contain one or more srun commands
to launch parallel tasks.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sbcast</b></span> is used to transfer a file
from local disk to local disk on the nodes allocated to a job. This can be
used to effectively use diskless compute nodes or provide improved performance
relative to a shared file system.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>scancel</b></span> is used to cancel a pending
or running job or job step. It can also be used to send an arbitrary signal to
all processes associated with a running job or job step.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>scontrol</b></span> is the administrative tool
used to view and/or modify SLURM state. Note that many <span class="commandline">scontrol</span>
commands can only be executed as user root.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sinfo</b></span> reports the state of partitions
and nodes managed by SLURM. It has a wide variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting
options.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>smap</b></span> reports state information for
jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by SLURM, but graphically displays the
information to reflect network topology.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>squeue</b></span> reports the state of jobs or
job steps. It has a wide variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting options.
By default, it reports the running jobs in priority order and then the pending
jobs in priority order.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>srun</b></span> is used to submit a job for
execution or initiate job steps in real time.
<span class="commandline">srun</span>
has a wide variety of options to specify resource requirements, including: minimum
and maximum node count, processor count, specific nodes to use or not use, and
specific node characteristics (so much memory, disk space, certain required
features, etc.).
A job can contain multiple job steps executing sequentially or in parallel on
independent or shared nodes within the job's node allocation.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>smap</b></span> reports state information for
jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by SLURM, but graphically displays the
information to reflect network topology.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>strigger</b></span> is used to set, get or
view event triggers. Event triggers include things such as nodes going down
or jobs approaching their time limit.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sview</b></span> is a graphical user interface to
get and update state information for jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by SLURM.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>First we determine what partitions exist on the system, what nodes
they include, and general system state. This information is provided
by the <span class="commandline">sinfo</span> command.
In the example below we find there are two partitions: <i>debug</i>
and <i>batch</i>.
The <i>*</i> following the name <i>debug</i> indicates this is the
default partition for submitted jobs.
We see that both partitions are in an <i>UP</i> state.
Some configurations may include partitions for larger jobs
that are <i>DOWN</i> except on weekends or at night. The information
about each partition may be split over more than one line so that
nodes in different states can be identified.
In this case, the two nodes <i>adev[1-2]</i> are <i>down</i>.
The <i>*</i> following the state <i>down</i> indicate the nodes are
not responding. Note the use of a concise expression for node
name specification with a common prefix <i>adev</i> and numeric
ranges or specific numbers identified. This format allows for
very clusters to be easily managed.
The <span class="commandline">sinfo</span> command
has many options to easily let you view the information of interest
to you in whatever format you prefer.
See the man page for more information.</p>
<pre>
adev0: sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT NODES  STATE NODELIST
debug*       up      30:00     2  down* adev[1-2]
debug*       up      30:00     3   idle adev[3-5]
batch        up      30:00     3  down* adev[6,13,15]
batch        up      30:00     3  alloc adev[7-8,14]
batch        up      30:00     4   idle adev[9-12]
</pre>

<p>Next we determine what jobs exist on the system using the
<span class="commandline">squeue</span> command. The
<i>ST</i> field is job state.
Two jobs are in a running state (<i>R</i> is an abbreviation
for <i>Running</i>) while one job is in a pending state
(<i>PD</i> is an abbreviation for <i>Pending</i>).
The <i>TIME</i> field shows how long the jobs have run
for using the format <i>days-hours:minutes:seconds</i>.
The <i>NODELIST(REASON)</i> field indicates where the
job is running or the reason it is still pending. Typical
reasons for pending jobs are <i>Resources</i> (waiting
for resources to become available) and <i>Priority</i>
(queued behind a higher priority job).
The <span class="commandline">squeue</span> command
has many options to easily let you view the information of interest
to you in whatever format you prefer.
See the man page for more information.</p>
<pre>
adev0: squeue

65648     batch  math  phil PD  0:00     6 (Resources)
</pre>

<p>The <span class="commandline">scontrol</span> command
can be used to report more detailed information about
nodes, partitions, jobs, job steps, and configuration.
It can also be used by system administrators to make
configuration changes. A couple of examples are shown
below. See the man page for more information.</p>

</pre>

<p>It is possible to create a resource allocation and launch
the tasks for a job step in a single command line using the
<span class="commandline">srun</span> command. Depending
upon the MPI implementation used, MPI jobs may also be
launched in this manner.
See the <a href="#mpi">MPI</a> section for more MPI-specific information.
In this example we execute <span class="commandline">/bin/hostname</span>
on three nodes (<i>-N3</i>) and include task numbers on the output (<i>-l</i>).
The default partition will be used.
One task per node will be used by default.
Note that the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command has
many options available to control what resource are allocated
and how tasks are distributed across those resources.</p>
<pre>
adev0: srun -N3 -l /bin/hostname
0: adev3
1: adev4
2: adev5
</pre>

<p>This variation on the previous example executes
<span class="commandline">/bin/hostname</span> in four tasks (<i>-n4</i>).
One processor per task will be used by default (note that we don't specify
a node count).</p>
<pre>
adev0: srun -n4 -l /bin/hostname
0: adev3
1: adev3
2: adev3
3: adev3
</pre>

<p>One common mode of operation is to submit a script for later execution.
In this example the script name is <i>my.script</i> and we explicitly use
the nodes adev9 and adev10 (<i>-w "adev[9-10]"</i>, note the use of a
node range expression).
We also explicitly state that the subsequent job steps will spawn four tasks
each, which will insure that our allocation contains at least four processors
(one processor per task to be launched).
The output will appear in the file my.stdout ("-o my.stdout").
This script contains a timelimit for the job embedded within itself.
Other options can be supplied as desired by using a prefix of "#SBATCH" followed
by the option at the beginning of the script (before any commands to be executed
in the script).
Options supplied on the command line would override any options specified within
the script.
Note that my.script contains the command <span class="commandline">/bin/hostname</span>
that executed on the first node in the allocation (where the script runs) plus
two job steps initiated using the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command
and executed sequentially.</p>
<pre>
adev0: cat my.script
#!/bin/sh
#SBATCH --time=1
/bin/hostname
srun -l /bin/hostname
srun -l /bin/pwd

adev0: sbatch -n4 -w &quot;adev[9-10]&quot; -o my.stdout my.script
sbatch: Submitted batch job 469

adev0: cat my.stdout
adev9
0: adev9
1: adev9
2: adev10
3: adev10
0: /home/jette
1: /home/jette
2: /home/jette
3: /home/jette
</pre>

<p>The final mode of operation is to create a resource allocation
and spawn job steps within that allocation.
The <span class="commandline">salloc</span> command is used
to create a resource allocation and typically start a shell within
that allocation.
One or more job steps would typically be executed within that allocation
using the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command to launch the tasks
(depending upon the type of MPI being used, the launch mechanism may
differ, see <a href="#mpi">MPI</a> details below).
Finally the shell created by <span class="commandline">salloc</span> would
be terminated using the <i>exit</i> command.
SLURM does not automatically migrate executable or data files
to the nodes allocated to a job.
Either the files must exists on local disk or in some global file system
(e.g. NFS or Lustre).
We provide the tool <span class="commandline">sbcast</span> to transfer
files to local storage on allocated nodes using SLURM's hierarchical
communications.
In this example we use <span class="commandline">sbcast</span> to transfer
the executable program <i>a.out</i> to <i>/tmp/joe.a.out</i> on local storage
of the allocated nodes.
After executing the program, we delete it from local storage</p>
<pre>
tux0: salloc -N1024 bash
$ sbcast a.out /tmp/joe.a.out
Granted job allocation 471
$ srun /tmp/joe.a.out
Result is 3.14159
$ srun rm /tmp/joe.a.out
$ exit
salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 471
</pre>

<p>In this example, we submit a batch job, get its status, and cancel it. </p>
<pre>
adev0: sbatch test
srun: jobid 473 submitted

adev0: squeue
JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  473 batch     test jill R  00:00 1     adev9

adev0: scancel 473

adev0: squeue
JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
</pre>

<h2><a name="mpi">MPI</a></h2>

<p>MPI use depends upon the type of MPI being used.
There are three fundamentally different modes of operation used
by these various MPI implementation.
<ol>
<li>SLURM directly launches the tasks and performs initialization
of communications (Quadrics MPI, MPICH2, MPICH-GM, MPICH-MX,
MVAPICH, MVAPICH2 and some MPICH1 modes).</li>
<li>SLURM creates a resource allocation for the job and then
mpirun launches tasks using SLURM's infrastructure (OpenMPI,
LAM/MPI and HP-MPI).</li>
<li>SLURM creates a resource allocation for the job and then
mpirun launches tasks using some mechanism other than SLURM,
such as SSH or RSH (BlueGene MPI and some MPICH1 modes).
These tasks initiated outside of SLURM's monitoring
or control. SLURM's epilog should be configured to purge
these tasks when the job's allocation is relinquished. </li>
</ol>
