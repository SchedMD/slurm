<h1>User Permissions</h1>

<p>Slurm supports several special user permissions as described below.</p>

<h2>Operator</h2>

<p>These users can add, modify, and remove any database object
(user, account, etc), and add other operators.
On a SlurmDBD served cluster, these users can
<ul>
<li>View information that is blocked to regular uses by a PrivateData flag</li>
<li>Create/Alter/Delete Reservations</li>
</ul>

<p>Set using an <b>AdminLevel</b> option in the user's database record.
For configuration information, see
<a href="accounting.html">Accounting and Resource Limits</a>.</p>

<h2>Admin</h2>

<p>These users have the same level of privileges as an operator in the database.
They can also alter anything on a served slurmctld as if they were the SlurmUser
or root.</p>

<p>An <b>AdminLevel</b> option in the user's database record.
For configuration information, see
<a href="accounting.html">Accounting and Resource Limits</a>.</p>

<h2>Coordinator</h2>

<p>A special privileged user, usually an account manager or such, that can add
users or sub-accounts to the account they are coordinator over.
This should be a trusted person since they can change limits on account and
user associations inside their realm.</p>

<p>Set using a table in Slurm's database defining user's and accounts for
which they can serve as coordinators.
For configuration information, see the
<a href="sacctmgr.html">sacctmgr</a> man page.</p>
