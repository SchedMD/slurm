<p><a name="comp"><b>1. Why is my job/node in COMPLETING state?</b></a><br>
When a job is terminating, both the job and its nodes enter the state &quot;completing.&quot; 
As the SLURM daemon on each node determines that all processes associated with 
the job have terminated, that node changes state to &quot;idle&quot; or some other 
appropriate state. When every node allocated to a job has determined that all 
processes associated with it have terminated, the job changes state to &quot;completed&quot; 
or some other appropriate state. Normally, this happens within a fraction of one 
second. However, if the job has processes that cannot be terminated with a SIGKILL, 
the job and one or more nodes can remain in the completing state for an extended 
period of time. This may be indicative of processes hung waiting for a core file 
to complete I/O or operating system failure. If this state persists, the system 
administrator should use the <span class="commandline">scontrol</span> command 
to change the node's state to DOWN (e.g. &quot;scontrol update 
NodeName=<i>name</i> State=DOWN Reason=hung_completing&quot;), reboot the node, 
then reset the node's state to IDLE (e.g. &quot;scontrol update 
NodeName=<i>name</i> State=RESUME&quot;).</p>

<p><a name="rlimit"><b>2. Why do I see the error &quot;Can't propagate RLIMIT_...&quot;?</b></a><br>
When the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command executes, it captures the 
resource limits in effect at that time. These limits are propagated to the allocated 
nodes before initiating the user's job. If the soft resource limits on the job 
submit host are higher than the hard resource limits on the allocated host, SLURM 
will be unable to propagate the resource limits and print an error of the type 
shown above. It is recommended that the system administrator establish uniform 
hard resource limits on all nodes within a cluster to prevent this from occurring.</p>

<p><a name="pending"><b>3. Why is my job not running?</b></a><br>
The answer to this question depends upon the scheduler used by SLURM. Executing 
the command</p>
<blockquote> 
<p> <span class="commandline">scontrol show config | grep SchedulerType</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p> will supply this information. If the scheduler type is <b>builtin</b>, then 
jobs will be executed in the order of submission for a given partition. Even if 
resources are available to initiate your job immediately, it will be deferred 
until no previously submitted job is pending. If the scheduler type is <b>backfill</b>, 
then jobs will generally be executed in the order of submission for a given partition 
with one exception: later submitted jobs will be initiated early if doing so does 
not delay the expected execution time of an earlier submitted job. In order for 
backfill scheduling to be effective, users jobs should specify reasonable time 
limits. If jobs do not specify time limits, then all jobs will receive the same 
time limit (that associated with the partition), and the ability to backfill schedule 
jobs will be limited. The backfill scheduler does not alter job specifications 
of required or excluded nodes, so jobs which specify nodes will substantially 
reduce the effectiveness of backfill scheduling. See the <a href="#backfill">
backfill</a> section for more details. If the scheduler type is <b>wiki</b>, 
this represents <a href="http://supercluster.org/maui">The Maui Scheduler</a>. 
Please refer to its documentation for help. For any scheduler, you can check priorities 
of jobs using the command <span class="commandline">scontrol show job</span>.</p>
<p><a name="sharing"><b>4. Why does the srun --overcommit option not permit multiple jobs 
to run on nodes?</b></a><br>
The <b>--overcommit</b> option is a means of indicating that a job or job step is willing 
to execute more than one task per processor in the job's allocation. For example, 
consider a cluster of two processor nodes. The srun execute line may be something 
of this sort 
<blockquote>
<p><span class="commandline">srun --ntasks=4 --nodes=1 a.out</span></p>
</blockquote>
This will result in not one, but two nodes being allocated so that each of the four 
tasks is given its own processor. Note that the srun <b>--nodes</b> option specifies 
a minimum node count and optionally a maximum node count. A command line of
<blockquote>
<p><span class="commandline">srun --ntasks=4 --nodes=1-1 a.out</span></p>
</blockquote>
would result in the request being rejected. If the <b>--overcommit</b> option 
is added to either command line, then only one node will be allocated for all 
four tasks to use.
<p>More than one job can execute simultaneously on the same nodes through the use 
of srun's <b>--shared</b> option in conjunction with the <b>Shared</b> parameter 
in SLURM's partition configuration. See the man pages for srun and slurm.conf for 
more information.
<p><a name="purge"><b>5. Why is my job killed prematurely?</b></a><br>
SLURM has a job purging mechanism to remove inactive jobs (resource allocations)
before reaching its time limit, which could be infinite.
This inactivity time limit is configurable by the system administrator. 
You can check it's value with the command
<blockquote>
<p><span class="commandline">scontrol show config | grep InactiveLimit</span></p>
</blockquote>
The value of InactiveLimit is in seconds. 
A zero value indicates that job purging is disabled. 
A job is considered inactive if it has no active job steps or if the srun 
command creating the job is not responding.
In the case of a batch job, the srun command terminates after the job script 
is submitted. 
Therefore batch job pre- and post-processing is limited to the InactiveLimit.
Contact your system administrator if you believe the InactiveLimit value 
should be changed. 

<p><a name="opts"><b>6. Why are my srun options ignored?</b></a><br>
Everything after the command <span class="commandline">srun</span> is 
examined to determine if it is a valid option for srun. The first 
token that is not a valid option for srun is considered the command 
to execute and everything after that is treated as an option to 
the command. For example:
<blockquote>
<p><span class="commandline">srun -N2 hostname -pdebug</span></p>
</blockquote>
srun processes "-N2" as an option to itself. "hostname" is the 
command to execute and "-pdebug" is treated as an option to the 
hostname command. Which will change the name of the computer 
on which SLURM executes the command - Very bad, <b>Don't run 
this command as user root!</b></p>

<p><a name="cred"><b>7. Why are &quot;Invalid job credential&quot; errors generated?
</b></a><br>
This error is indicative of SLURM's job credential files being inconsistent across 
the cluster. All nodes in the cluster must have the matching public and private 
keys as defined by <b>JobCredPrivateKey</b> and <b>JobCredPublicKey</b> in the 
slurm configuration file <b>slurm.conf</b>.

<p><a name="backfill"><b>8. Why is the SLURM backfill scheduler not starting my job?
</b></a><br>
There are significant limitations in the current backfill scheduler plugin. 
It was designed to perform backfill node scheduling for a homogeneous cluster.
It does not manage scheduling on individual processors (or other consumable 
resources). It also does not update the required or excluded node list of 
individual jobs. These are the current limiations. You can use the 
scontrol show command to check if these conditions apply. 
<ul>
<li>partition: State=UP</li>
<li>partition: RootOnly=NO</li>
<li>partition: Shared=NO</li>
<li>job: ReqNodeList=NULL</li>
<li>job: ExcNodeList=NULL</li>
<li>job: Contiguous=0</li>
<li>job: Features=NULL</li>
<li>job: MinProcs, MinMemory, and MinTmpDisk satisfied by all nodes in 
the partition</li>
<li>job: MinProcs or MinNodes not to exceed partition's MaxNodes</li>
</ul>
As soon as any priority-ordered job in the partition's queue fail to 
satisfy the request, no lower priority job in that partition's queue 
will be considered as a backfill candidate. Any programmer wishing 
to augment the existing code is welcome to do so. 

<p><a name="suspend"><b>9. How is job suspend/resume useful?</b></a><br>
Job suspend/resume is most useful to get particularly large jobs initiated 
in a timely fashion with minimal overhead. Say you want to get a full-system
job initiated. Normally you would need to either cancel all running jobs 
or wait for them to terminate. Canceling jobs results in the loss of 
their work to that point from either their beginning or last checkpoint.
Waiting for the jobs to terminate can take hours, depending upon your
system configuration. A more attractive alternative is to suspend the 
running jobs, run the full-system job, then resume the suspended jobs. 
This can easily be accomplished by configuring a special queue for 
full-system jobs and using a script to control the process. 
The script would stop the other partitions, suspend running jobs in those 
partitions, and start the full-system partition. 
The process can be reversed when desired.  
One can effectively gang schedule (time-slice) multiple jobs 
using this mechanism, although the algorithms to do so can get quite 
complex.
Suspending and resuming a job makes use of the SIGSTOP and SIGCONT 
signals respectively, so swap and disk space should be sufficient to 
accommodate all jobs allocated to a node, either running or suspended.

<p><a name="fast_schedule"><b>10. How can I configure SLURM to use 
the resources actually found on a node rather than what is defined 
in <i>slurm.conf</i>?</b></a><br>
SLURM can either base it's scheduling decisions upon the node 
configuration defined in <i>slurm.conf</i> or what each node 
actually returns as available resources. 
This is controlled using the configuration parameter <i>FastSchedule</i>.
Set it's value to zero in order to use the resources actually 
found on each node, but with a higher overhead for scheduling.
A value of one is the default and results in the node configuration 
defined in <i>slurm.conf</i> being used. See &quot;man slurm.conf&quot;
for more details.</p>

<p><a name="return_to_service"><b>11. Why is a node shown in state 
DOWN when the node has registered for service?</b></a><br>
The configuration parameter <i>ReturnToService</i> in <i>slurm.conf</i>
controls how DOWN nodes are handled. 
Set its value to one in order for DOWN nodes to automatically be 
returned to service once the <i>slurmd</i> daemon registers 
with a valid node configuration.
A value of zero is the default and results in a node staying DOWN 
until an administrator explicity returns it to service using 
the command &quot;scontrol update NodeName=whatever State=RESUME&quot;.
See &quot;man slurm.conf&quot; and &quot;man scontrol&quot; for more 
details.</p>

<p><a name="down_node"><b>12. What happens when a node crashes?</b></a><br>
A node is set DOWN when the slurmd daemon on it stops responding 
for <i>SlurmdTimeout</i> as defined in <i>slurm.conf</i>.
The node can also be set DOWN when certain errors occur or the 
node's configuration is inconsistent with that defined in <i>slurm.conf</i>.
Any active job on that node will be killed unless it was submitted 
with the srun option <i>--no-kill</i>.
Any active job step on that node will be killed. 
See the slurm.conf and srun man pages for more information.</p>
