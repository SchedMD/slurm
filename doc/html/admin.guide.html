<h1>SLURM Administrator's Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
scheduling system for Linux clusters having 
thousands of nodes.  Components include machine status, partition
management, job management, and scheduling modules.  The design also 
includes a scalable, general-purpose communication infrastructure.
SLURM requires no kernel modifications and is relatively self-contained. 
There is a "control" machine, which orchestrates SLURM activities. A "backup 
controller" is also desirable to assume control functions in the event 
of a failure in the control machine. There are also compute servers on 
which applications execute, which can number in the thousands.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
There a single SLURM configuration file containing: 
overall SLURM options, node configurations, and partition configuration. 
This file is located at "/etc/SLURM.conf" by default.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the 
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter.
The overall SLURM configuration options specify the control and backup 
control machines. 
The locations of daemons, state information storage, and other details 
are specified at build time. 
See the <a href="#Build">Build Parameters</a> section for details. 
The node configuration tell SLURM what nodes it is to manage as well as 
their expected configuration. 
The partition configuration permits you to define sets (or partitions) 
of nodes and establish distinct job limits or access control for them. 
Configuration information may be read or updated using SLURM APIs.
This configuration file or a copy of it must be accessible on every computer under 
SLURM management. 
<p>
The following parameters may be specified:
<dl>
<dt>ControlMachine
<dd>The name of the machine where SLURM control functions are executed 
(e.g. "lx01"). This value must be specified.

<dt>BackupController
<dd>The name of the machine where SLURM control functions are to be 
executed in the event that ControlMachine fails (e.g. "lx02"). This node
may also be used as a compute server if so desired. It will come into service 
as a controller only upon the failure of ControlMachine and will revert 
to a "standby" mode when the ControlMachine becomes available once again. 
While not essential, it is highly recommended that you specify a backup 
controller.
</dl>
Any text after "#" until the end of the line in the configuration file 
will be considered a comment. 
If you need to use "#" in a value within the configuration file, proceed 
it with backslash "\").
The configuration file should contain a keyword followed by an 
equal sign, followed by the value. 
Keyword value pairs should be separated from each other by white space. 
The field descriptor keywords are case sensitive. 
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters. 
A sample SLURM configuration file (without node or partition information)
follows.
<pre>
# /etc/SLURM.conf
# Built by John Doe, 1/29/2002
ControlMachine=lx01
BackupController=lx02
</pre>
<p>
The node configuration permits you to identify the nodes (or machines) 
to be managed by SLURM. You may also identify the 
characteristics of the nodes in the configuration file. SLURM operates 
in a heterogeneous environment and users are able to specify resource 
requirements for each job 
The node configuration specifies the following information: 
<dl>

<dt>NodeName
<dd>Name of a node as returned by hostname (e.g. "lx12"). 
<a name="NodeExp">A simple real expression may optionally be used to specify ranges 
of nodes to avoid building a configuration file with thousands 
of entries. The real expression can contain one  
pair of square brackets optionally followed by "o"
for octal (the default is decimal) followed by 
a number followed by a "-" followed by another number. 
SLURM considers every number in the specified range to 
identify a valid node. Some possible NodeName values include:
"solo", "lx[00-64]", "linux[0-64]", and "slurm[o00-77]".</a> 
If the NodeName is "DEFAULT", the values specified 
with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications   
unless explicitly set to other values in that node record or 
replaced with a different set of default values. 
For architectures in which the node order is significant, 
nodes will be considered consecutive in the order defined. 
For example, if the configuration for NodeName=charlie immediately 
follows the configuration for NodeName=baker they will be 
considered adjacent in the computer.

<dt>CPUs
<dd>Number of processors on the node (e.g. "2").
The default value is 1.

<dt>Feature
<dd>A comma delimited list of arbitrary strings indicative of some 
characteristic associated with the node. 
There is no value associated with a feature at this time, a node 
either has a feature or it does not.  
If desired a feature may contain a numeric component indicating, 
for example, processor speed. 
By default a node has no features.
<dt>RealMemory
<dd>Size of real memory on the node in MegaBytes (e.g. "2048").
The default value is 1.

<dt>State
<dd>State of the node with respect to the initiation of user jobs. 
Acceptable values are "UNKNOWN", "IDLE", "BUSY", "DOWN", "DRAINED", 
"DRAINING". For example, the SLURM control machine may very well 
not be used for initiation of user jobs and its state could thus 
be set to "DRAINED". The default value is "UNKNOWN".

<dt>TmpDisk
<dd>Total size of temporary disk storage in TMP_FS in MegaBytes 
(e.g. "16384"). TMP_FS (for "Temporary File System") 
identifies the location which jobs should use for temporary storage. The
value of TMP_FS is set at SLURM build time. 
Note this does not indicate the amount of free 
space available to the user on the node, only the total file 
system size. The system administration should insure this file 
system is purged as needed so that user jobs have access to 
most of this space. 
The PROLOG and/or EPILOG programs (specified at build time) might 
be used to insure the file system is kept clean. 
The default value is 1.

<dt>Weight
<dd>The priority of the node for scheduling purposes. 
All things being equal, jobs will be allocated the nodes with 
the lowest weight which satisfies their requirements. 
For example, a heterogeneous collection of nodes might 
be placed into a single partition for greater system
utilization, responsiveness and capability. It would be 
preferable to allocate smaller memory nodes rather than larger 
memory nodes if either will satisfy a job's requirements. 
The units of weight are arbitrary, but larger weights 
should be assigned to nodes with more CPUs, memory, 
disk space, higher processor speed, etc.
Weight is an integer value with a default value of 1.

</dl>
<p>
Only the NodeName must be supplied in the configuration file; all other 
items are optional.
It is advisable to establish baseline node configurations in the configuration 
file, especially if the cluster is heterogeneous.
Nodes which register to the system with less than the configured resources 
(e.g. too little memory), will be placed in the "DOWN" state to 
avoid scheduling jobs on them. 
The resources checked at node registration time are: CPUs, 
RealMemory and TmpDisk. 
While baseline values for each of these can be established 
in the configuration file, the actual values upon node 
registration are recorded and these actual values are 
used for scheduling purposes.
Default values can be specified with a record in which 
"NodeName" is "DEFAULT". 
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the 
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times 
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "NodeName=DEFAULT".
The "NodeName="  specification must be placed on every line 
describing the configuration of nodes. 
Each nodes configuration must be specified on a single line 
rather than having the various values established on multiple lines. 
In fact, it is generally possible and desirable to define the 
configurations of all nodes in only a few lines.
This convention permits significant optimization in the scheduling 
of larger clusters. 
The field descriptors above are case sensitive. 
In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes
on some architectures, 
node specifications should be place in this file in consecutive order.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
<p>
The node states have the following meanings:
<dl>
<dt>BUSY
<dd>The node has been allocated work (one or more user jobs) and is 
processing it. 

<dt>DOWN
<dd>The node is unavailable for use. It has been explicitly configured 
DOWN or failed to respond to system state inquiries or has 
explicitly removed itself from service due to a failure. This state 
typically indicates some problem requiring administrator intervention.

<dt>DRAINED
<dd>The node is idle, but not available for use. The state of a node 
will automatically change from DRAINING to DRAINED when user job(s) executing 
on that node terminate. Since this state is entered by explicit 
administrator request, additional SLURM administrator intervention is typically 
not required.

<dt>DRAINING
<dd>The node has been made unavailable for new work by explicit administrator 
intervention. It is processing some work at present and will enter state
"DRAINED" when that work has been completed. This might be used to 
prepare some nodes for maintenance work.

<dt>IDLE
<dd>The node is idle and available for use.

<dt>UNKNOWN
<dd>Default initial node state upon startup of SLURM.
An attempt will be made to contact the node and acquire current state information.

</dl>
<p>
SLURM uses a hash table in order to locate table entries rapidly. 
Each table entry can be directly accessed without any searching
if the name contains a sequence number suffix. SLURM can be built 
with the HASH_BASE set at build time to indicate the hashing algorithm. 
Possible contains values are "10" and "8" for names containing 
decimal and octal sequence numbers respectively
or "0" which processes mixed alpha-numeric without sequence numbers. 
The default value of HASH_BASE is "10".
If you use a naming convention lacking a sequence number, it may be 
desirable to review the hashing function Hash_Index in the 
node_mgr.c module. This is especially important in clusters having 
large numbers of nodes.  The sequence numbers can start at any 
desired number, but should contain consecutive numbers. The 
sequence number portion may contain leading zeros for a consistent 
name length, if so desired. Note that correct operation 
will be provided with any nodes names, but performance will suffer 
without this optimization.
A sample SLURM configuration file (node information only) follows.
<pre>
# Node specifications
NodeName=DEFAULT       TmpDisk=16384
NodeName=lx[0001-0002] State=DRAINED
NodeName=lx[0003-0016] CPUs=16 RealMemory=2048 Weight=16
NodeName=lx[0017-8096] CPUs=32 RealMemory=4096 Weight=40 Feature=1200MHz,VizTools
</pre>
<p>
The partition configuration permits you to establish different job 
limits or access controls for various groups (or partitions) of nodes. 
Nodes may be in only one partition. The partition configuration 
file contains the following information: 
<dl>
<dt>AllowGroups
<dd>Comma separated list of group IDs which may use the partition. 
If at least one group associated with the user submitting the 
job is in AllowGroups, he will be permitted to use this partition.
The default value is "ALL". 

<dt>Default
<dd>If this keyword is set, jobs submitted without a partition 
specification will utilize this partition.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO". 
The default value is "NO".

<dt>Key
<dd>Specifies if SLURM provided key is required for a job to 
execute in this partition.
The key is provided to user root upon request and is invalidated 
after one use or expiration.
The key may be used to deligate control of partitions to external 
schedulers.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO". 
The default value is "NO".

<dt>MaxNodes
<dd>Maximum count of nodes which may be allocated to any single job,
The default value is "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.

<dt>MaxTime
<dd>Maximum wall-time limit for any job in minutes. The default 
value is "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.

<dt>Nodes
<dd>Comma separated list of nodes which are associated with this 
partition. Node names may be specified using the <a href="#NodeExp">
real expression syntax</a> described above. A blank list of nodes 
(i.e. "Nodes= ") can be used if one wants a partition to exist, 
but have no resources (possibly on a temporary basis).

<dt>PartitionName
<dd>Name by which the partition may be referenced (e.g. "Interactive"). 
This name can be specified by users when submitting jobs.

<dt>Shared
<dd>Ability of the partition to execute more than one job at a 
time on each node. Shared nodes will offer unpredictable performance 
for application programs, but can provide higher system utilization 
and responsiveness than otherwise possible. 
Possible values are "YES" and "NO". The default value is "NO".

<dt>State
<dd>State of partition or availability for use.  Possible values 
are "UP" or "DOWN". The default value is "UP".

</dl>
<p>
Only the PartitionName must be supplied in the configuration file. 
Other parameters will assume default values if not specified. 
The default values can be specified with a record in which 
"PartitionName" is "DEFAULT" if non-standard default values are desired. 
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the 
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times 
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "PartitionName=DEFAULT". 
The configuration of one partition should be specified per line.
The field descriptors above are case sensitive. 
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
A sample SLURM configuration file (partition information only) follows.
<p>
A single job may be allocated nodes from only one partition and 
satisfy the configuration specifications for that partitions. 
The job may specify a particular PartitionName, if so desired, 
or use the system's default partition.
<pre>
# Partition specifications
PartitionName=DEFAULT Key=NO
PartitionName=batch   MaxNodes=10 MaxTime=UNLIMITED Nodes=lx[10-30] Key=YES
PartitionName=debug   MaxNodes=2  MaxTime=60        Nodes=lx[03-09] Default=YES
PartitionName=class   MaxNodes=1  MaxTime=10        Nodes=lx[31-32] AllowGroups=students
</pre>
<p>
APIs and an administrative tool can be used to alter the SLRUM 
configuration in real time. 
When the SLURM controller restarts, it's state will be restored 
to that at the time it terminated unless the SLURM configuration 
file is newer, it which case the configuration will be rebuilt 
from that file. 
State information not incorporated in the configuration file, 
such as job state, will be preserved.
A <a href="#SampleConfig">SLURM configuration file</a> is included 
at the end of this document.

<h3>Job Configuration</h3>
The job configuration format specified below is used by the 
slurm_admin administration tool to modify job state information: 
<dl>

<dt>Contiguous
<dd>If this keyword is present, the nodes allocated to the job must 
be contiguous.

<dt>CPUCount
<dd>Minimum total number of CPUs to be allocated to the job.

<dt>Features
<dd>Required features of nodes to be allocated to this job. 
Features may be combined using "|" for OR, "&amp;" for AND,  
parenthesis and square brackets. 
For example, "Features=((1000MHz|1200MHz)&amp;CoolTool)".
Square brackets are used to identify alternate features, 
but ones that must apply to every node allocated to the job. 
For example, some clusters are configured with more than 
one parallel file system. These parallel file systems 
may be accessible only to a subset of the nodes in a cluster. 
The application may not care which parallel file system 
is used, but all nodes allocated to it must be in the
subset of nodes assessing a single parallel file system. 
This might be specified with a specification of 
"Features=[PFS1|PFS2|PFS3|PFS3]".

<dt>Group
<dd>Comma separated list of group names to which the user belongs.

<dt>Key
<dd>Key granted to user root for optional access control to partitions.
<dt>Name
<dd>Name by which the job may be referenced (e.g. "Simulation"). 
This name can be specified by users when submitting their jobs.

<dt>MaxTime
<dd>Maximum wall-time limit for the job in minutes. An "UNLIMITED"
value is represented internally as -1.

<dt>MinCPUs
<dd>Minimum number of CPUs per node.

<dt>MinRealMemory
<dd>Minimum number of megabytes of real memory per node.

<dt>MinTmpDisk
<dd>Minimum number of megabytes of temporary disk storage per node.

<dt>NodeCount
<dd>Minimum total number of nodes to be allocated to the job.

<dt>NodeList
<dd>Comma separated list of nodes which are allocated to the job. 
The nodes may be specified using regular expressions (e.g.
"lx[10-20],lx[33-40]".
This value may not be changed by slurm_admin. 

<dt>Number
<dd>Unique number by which the job can be referenced. This value 
may not be changed by slurm_admin.

<dt>Partition
<dd>Name of the partition in which this job should execute.

<dt>State
<dd>State of the job.  Possible values are "PENDING", "STARTING", 
"RUNNING", and "ENDING". 

<dt>User
<dd>Name of the user executing this job.

</dl>

<a name="Build"><h2>Build Parameters</h2></a>
The following configuration parameters are established at SLURM build time. 
State and configuration information may be read or updated using SLURM APIs.

<dl>
<dt>BACKUP_INTERVAL
<dd>How long to wait between saving SLURM state. The default 
value is 60 and the units are seconds.

<dt>BACKUP_LOCATION
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file where the SLURM 
state information is saved. There is no default value. The file should 
be accessible to both the ControlMachine and also the BackupController.
The default value is "/usr/local/SLURM/Slurm.state".

<dt>CONTROL_DAEMON
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file containing the SLURM daemon
to execute on the ControlMachine. The default value is "/usr/local/SLURM/bin/Slurmd.Control".
This file must be accessible to the ControlMachine and BackupController.

<dt>CONTROLLER_TIMEOUT
<dd>How long the BackupController waits for the CONTROL_DAEMON to respond 
before assuming it has failed and starting the BackupController. 
The default value is 300 and the units are seconds.

<dt>EPILOG
<dd>This program is executed on each node allocated to a job upon its termination. 
This can be used to remove temporary files created by the job or other clean-up.
This file must be accessible to every SLURM compute server. 
By default there is no epilog program. 

<dt>HASH_BASE
<dd>SLURM uses a hash table in order to locate table entries rapidly. 
Each table entry can be directly accessed without any searching
if the name contains a sequence number suffix. SLURM can be built 
with the HASH_BASE set to indicate the hashing mechanism. Possible 
values are "10" and "8" for names containing  
decimal and octal sequence numbers respectively
or "0" which processes mixed alpha-numeric without sequence numbers. 
If you use a naming convention lacking a sequence number, it may be 
desirable to review the hashing function Hash_Index in the 
Mach_Stat_Mgr.c module. This is especially important in clusters having 
large numbers of nodes.  The default value is "10".

<dt>HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL
<dd>How frequently each SERVER_DAEMON should report its state to the CONTROL_DAEMON. 
Also, how frequently the CONTROL_DAEMON should report its state to the BackupController. 
The default value is 60 and the units are seconds.

<dt>INIT_PROGRAM
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of a program that must execute and 
return an exit code of zero before the CONTROL_DAEMON or SERVER_DAEMON 
enter into service. This would normally be used to insure that the 
computer is fully ready for executing user jobs. It may, for example, 
wait until every required file system has been mounted.
By default there is no initialization program.

<dt>KILL_WAIT
<dd>How long to wait between sending SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals to jobs at termination time.
The default value is 60 and the units are seconds.

<dt>PROLOG
<dd>This program is executed on each node allocated to a job prior to its initiation. 
This file must be accessible to every SLURM compute server. By default no prolog is executed. 

<dt>SERVER_DAEMON
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file containing the SLURM daemon
to execute on every compute server node. The default value is "/usr/local/SLURM/bin/Slurmd.Server".
This file must be accessible to every SLURM compute server.

<dt>SERVER_TIMEOUT
<dd>How long the CONTROL_DAEMON waits for the SERVER_DAEMON to respond before assuming it 
has failed and declaring the node DOWN then terminating any job running on 
it. The default value is 300 and the units are seconds.

<dt>SLURM_CONF
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file containing the SLURM 
configuration file. The default value is "/etc/SLURM.conf".

<dt>TMP_FS 
<dd>The fully qualified pathname of the file system which jobs should use for 
temporary storage. The default value is "/tmp".
</dl>

<h2>Slurm_admin Administration Tool</h2>
The tool you will primarily use in the administration of SLURM is slurm_admin. 
It provides the means of viewing and updating node and partition 
configurations. It can also be used to update some job state 
information. You can execute slurm_admin with a single keyword on 
the execute line or it will query you for input and process those 
keywords on an interactive basis. The slurm_admin keywords are shown below.
A <a href="#SampleAdmin">sample slurm_admin session</a> with examples is appended.

<p>
Usage: slurm_admin [-q | -v] [&lt;keyword&gt;]<br>
-q is equivalent to the "quiet" keyword<br>
-v is equivalent to the "verbose" keyword<br>
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>exit
<dd>Terminate slurm_admin.

<dt>help
<dd>Display this list of slurm_admin commands and options.

<dt>quiet
<dd>Print no messages other than error messages.

<dt>quit
<dd>Terminate slurm_admin.

<dt>reconfigure [&lt;NodeName&gt;]
<dd>The SLURM daemons on the specified node are instructed to re-read 
the configuration files. The default is that all daemons on all nodes 
are reconfigured. NodeName may be specified using a real expression.

<dt>show &lt;entity&gt; [&lt;ID&gt;]
<dd>Show the configuration for a given entity. Entity must 
be "job", "node", or "partition". By default, state information 
for all records is reported. If you only wish to see the 
state of one entity record, specify either its ID number
(assumed if entirely numeric) or its name. 

<dt>update &lt;options&gt;
<dd>Update the configuration information. 
Options are of the same format as the configuration file. 
This command can only be issued by user <b>root</b>.

<dt>verbose
<dd>Enable detailed logging of slurm_admin execution state information.

<dt>version
<dd>Display the slurm_admin tool version number.

<dt>write &lt;filename&gt;
<dd>Write current configuration information to the specified file. 
This file can subsequently be used as a SLURM configuration file. 
This file can be quite verbose as regular expressions will not be 
used for node identification. (To do: add regular expressions) 
</dl>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
There is no necessity for synchronized clocks on the nodes. 
Events occur either in real-time based upon message traffic 
or based upon changes in the time on a node. However, synchronized 
clocks will permit easier analysis of SLURM logs from multiple 
nodes.
<p>
SLURM uses the syslog function to record events. It uses a 
range of importance levels for these messages. Be certain
that your system's syslog functionality is operational.
