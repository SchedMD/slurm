<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>
<p>SchedMD maintains two Slurm mailing lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>slurm-announce@schedmd.com</b> is designated for communications about
Slurm releases. Only SchedMD may post to this list. Low traffic.</li>
<li><b>slurm-users@schedmd.com</b> (formerly slurm-dev@schedmd.com) is for
discussion by the Slurm community, and is typically used by Slurm system
administrators for discussion and community-provided support. (Please see the
<a href="https://www.schedmd.com/support.php">SchedMD support page</a>
page for commercial support options.)
Any person subscribed to this mailing list may post to it. High traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can subscribe to either list, change your subscription options, or
