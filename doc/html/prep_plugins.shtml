<h1><a name="top">PrEp Plugin API</a></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This document describes the Slurm PrEp &mdash; short for "Pr"olog and
"Ep"ilog &mdash; plugins API. It is intended as a resource to programmers
wishing to write their own Slurm prep plugins.</p>

<p>The purpose of the prep plugin APIs to provide a native C interface to the
same hooks traditionally used by the <i>Prolog</i>, <i>Epilog</i>,
<i>PrologSlurmctld</i>, and <i>EpilogSlurmctld</i> scripts. Those interfaces
are now implemented through the <i>prep/script</i> plugin, and that plugin
serves as a good example of how to approach development of additional
plugins.</p>

<p>Slurm PrEp plugins must conform to the Slurm Plugin API with the following
specifications:</p>

<p><span class="commandline">
const char plugin_name[]="<i>full&nbsp;text&nbsp;name</i>"
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in">
A free-formatted ASCII text string that identifies the plugin.
</p>

<p><span class="commandline">
const char plugin_type[]="<i>major/minor</i>"
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in">
The major type must be &quot;prep&quot;.
The minor type can be any suitable name for the type of prep plugin.
</p>

<p><span class="commandline">const uint32_t plugin_version</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in">
If specified, identifies the version of Slurm used to build this plugin and
any attempt to load the plugin from a different version of Slurm will result
in an error.
If not specified, then the plugin may be loaded by Slurm commands and
daemons from any version, however this may result in difficult to diagnose
failures due to changes in the arguments to plugin functions or changes
in other Slurm functions used by the plugin.
</p>

<p>Slurm can be configured to use multiple prep plugins if desired through the
PrEpPlugins configuration option. Additional plugins should be comma-separated.
Note that, by default, the <i>prep/script</i> plugin is loaded if that option
is not set, but will not be loaded if an explict setting has been made. Thus,
if you do set that option, and intend to still use the <i>Prolog</i>,
<i>Epilog</i>, <i>PrologSlurmctld</i>, and/or <i>EpilogSlurmctld</i> options
you will need to ensure both your additional plugin and <i>prep/script</i> are
set.</p>

<p>Special care must be used when developing against the
<span class="commandline">prep_p_prolog_slurmctld()</span> or
<span class="commandline">prep_p_epilog_slurmctld()</span> interfaces. These
functions are called while the slurmctld holds a number of internal locks,
and need to return quickly otherwise slurmctld responsiveness and system
throughput will be impacted. For simple logging, this is not required, and
the "async" option can be left to false. But, especially for anything
communicating with an external API or spawning additional processes, it is
highly recommended to first make a local copy of any job record details
required, and then spawn a separate processing thread &mdash; which, by default,
will not have inherited any slurmctld locks &mdash; to continue processing.
You must set the async return value to true, and call the corresponding
<span class="commandline">prolog_slurmctld_callback()</span> or
<span class="commandline">epilog_slurmctld_callback()</span> function before
the thread exits. These callbacks are provided as function pointers when the
slurmctld starts through
<span class="commandline">prep_p_register_callbacks()</span> call, and these
function pointers should be cached locally in your plugin.</p>

<h2>API Functions</h2>
<p>All of the following functions are required. Functions which are not
implemented must be stubbed.</p>

<p class="commandline">int init(void)</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br />
  Called when the plugin is loaded, before any other functions are
  called. Put global initialization here.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br />
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or<br />
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure.</p>

<p class="commandline">void fini(void)</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when the plugin is removed. Clear any allocated storage here.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: None.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: These init and fini functions are not the same as those
described in the <span class="commandline">dlopen (3)</span> system library.
The C run-time system co-opts those symbols for its own initialization.
The system <span class="commandline">_init()</span> is called before the Slurm
<span class="commandline">init()</span>, and the Slurm
<span class="commandline">fini()</span> is called before the system's
<span class="commandline">_fini()</span>.</p>

<p class="commandline">
void prep_p_register_callbacks(prep_callbacks_t *callbacks)
</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
This function is called by the slurmctld to pass function pointer addresses
used with asynchronous operation with the prep_p_prolog_slurmctld() and
prep_p_epilog_slurmctld() interfaces. These pointers must be saved if
asynchronous operation is used, otherwise this function can be an empty stub.
</p>

<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>: <br>
<span class="commandline">callbacks</span>
(input) contains function pointers for use with asynchronous operation within the slurmctld
</p>

<p class="commandline">
int prep_p_prolog(job_env_t *job_env, slurm_cred_t *cred)

compute node.

<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br>
<span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or<br>
<span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure, will cause job failure.
