<h1>Slurm Workload Manager</h1>

<p>Slurm is an open-source workload manager designed for Linux clusters of
all sizes.
It provides three key functions.
First it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources
(computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work.
Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work
(typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes.
Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of
pending work. </p>

<p>Slurm's design is very modular with dozens of optional plugins.
In its simplest configuration, it can be installed and configured in a
couple of minutes (see <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7239/1/">
Caos NSA and Perceus: All-in-one Cluster Software Stack</a>
by Jeffrey B. Layton).
More complex configurations can satisfy the job scheduling needs of 
world-class computer centers and rely upon a
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database for archiving
<a href="accounting.html">accounting</a> records, managing
<a href="resource_limits.html">resource limits</a> by user or bank account,
or supporting sophisticated
<a href="priority_multifactor.html">job prioritization</a> algorithms.</p>

<p>While other workload managers do exist, Slurm is unique in several
respects:
<ul>
<li><b>Scalability</b>: It is designed to operate in a heterogeneous cluster
with up to tens of millions of processors.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>: It can accept 1,000 job submissions per second and
fully execute 500 simple jobs per second (depending upon hardware and system
configuration).</li>
<li><b>Free and Open Source</b>: Its source code is freely available under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.</li>
<li><b>Portability</b>: Written in C with a GNU autoconf configuration engine.
While initially written for Linux, Slurm has been ported to a diverse assortment
of systems.</li>
<li><b>Power Management</b>: Job can specify their desired CPU frequency and
power use by job is recorded. Idle resources can be powered down until needed.</li>
<li><b>Fault Tolerant</b>: It is highly tolerant of system failures, including
failure of the node executing its control functions.</li>
<li><b>Flexibility</b>: A plugin mechanism exists to support various
interconnects, authentication mechanisms, schedulers, etc. These plugins are
documented and  simple enough for the motivated end user to understand the
source and add functionality.</li>
<li><b>Resizable Jobs</b>: Jobs can grow and shrink on demand. Job submissions
can specify size and time limit ranges.</li>
<li><b>Status Jobs</b>: Status running jobs at the level of individual tasks to
help identify load imbalances and other anomalies.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Slurm provides workload management on many of the most powerful computers in
the world. On the November 2013 <a href="http://www.top500.org">Top500</a> list,
five of the ten top systems use Slurm including the number one system.
These five systems alone contain over 5.7 million cores.
A few of the systems using Slurm are listed below:
