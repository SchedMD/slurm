<h1>SLURM: A Highly Scalable Resource Manager</h1>

<p>SLURM is an open-source resource manager designed for Linux clusters of
all sizes.
It provides three key functions.
First it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources
(computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work.
Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work
(typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes.
Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of
pending work. </p>

<p>SLURM's design is very modular with dozens of optional plugins.
In its simplest configuration, it can be installed and configured in a
couple of minutes (see <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7239/1/">
Caos NSA and Perceus: All-in-one Cluster Software Stack</a>
by Jeffrey B. Layton) and is used by
<a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a> on their 48-core
<a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/features/Intel-Unveils-48-Core-Research-Chip-78378487.html">
"cluster on a chip"</a>.
More complex configurations can satisfy the job scheduling needs of 
world-class computer centers and rely upon a
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database for archiving
<a href="accounting.html">accounting</a> records, managing
<a href="resource_limits.html">resource limits</a> by user or bank account,
or supporting sophisticated
<a href="priority_multifactor.html">job prioritization</a> algorithms.</p>

<p>While other resource managers do exist, SLURM is unique in several
respects:
<ul>
<li>It is designed to operate in a heterogeneous cluster with up to millions of
processors (2.1 million sockets scheduled on an emulated IBM BlueGene/Q system).</li>
<li>It can sustain a throughput rate of over 120,000 jobs per hour with
bursts of job submissions at several times that rate.</li>
<li>Its source code is freely available under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.</li>
<li>It is portable; written in C with a GNU autoconf configuration engine.
While initially written for Linux, other UNIX-like operating systems should
be easy porting targets.</li>
<li>It is highly tolerant of system failures, including failure of the node
executing its control functions.</li>
<li>A plugin mechanism exists to support various interconnects, authentication
mechanisms, schedulers, etc. These plugins are documented and  simple enough
for the motivated end user to understand the source and add functionality.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>SLURM provides resource management on many of the most powerful computers in
the world including:
