	<h2> Keynote Speaker</h2>
	Challenges and Opportunities for Exscale Resource Management and how
	Today's Petascale Systems are Guiding the Way<br>
	William Kramer (NCSA)<br><br>
	Resource management challenges currently experienced on the Blue Waters
	computer will be described. These experiences will be extended to describe
	the additional challenges faced in exascale and trans-petascale systems.

	<h2>Session #1</h2>
	CEA Site report<br>
	Matthieu Hautreux (CEA)<br><br>
	Evolutions and feedback from Tera100. SLURM on Curie, the PRACE second Tier-0 
	system that is planned to be installed by the end of the year in a new facility 
	hosted at CEA. Curie will be a 1.6 Petaflop system from Bull.

	<h2>Session #2</h2>
	LLNL site report<br>
	Don Lipari (LLNL)<br><br>
	Don Lipari will provide an overview of the batch scheduling systems in use 
	at LLNL and an overview on how they are managed.

	<h2>Session #3</h2>
	SLURM Simulator<br>
	Alejandro Lucero Palau (BSC)<br><br>
	Batch scheduling for high performance cluster installations has two main goals:
	1) to keep the whole machine working at full capacity at all times, and 
	2) to respect priorities avoiding lower priority jobs jeopardizing higher 
	priority ones. Usually, batch schedulers allow different policies with 
	several variables to be tuned by policy. Other features like special job
	requests, reservations or job preemption increase the complexity for achiev-
	ing a fine-tuned algorithm. A local decision for a specific job can change
	the full scheduling for a high number of jobs and what can be thought
	as logical within a short term could make no sense for a long trace mea-
	sured in weeks or months. Although it is possible to extract algorithms
	from batch scheduling software to make simulations of large job traces,
	this is not the ideal approach since scheduling is not an isolated part of
	this type of tools and replicating same environment requires an important
	effort plus a high maintenance cost. We present a method for obtaining a
	special mode of operation for a real production-ready scheduling software,
	SLURM, where we can simulate execution of real job traces to evaluate
	impact of scheduling policies and policy tuning.

	<h2>Session #4</h2>
	SLURM Operation on IBM BlueGene/Q<br>
	Danny Auble (SchedMD)<br><br>
	SLURM version 2.3 supports IBM BlueGene/Q. This presentation will report the 
	design and operation of SLURM with respect to BlueGene/Q systems.

	<h2>Session #5</h2>
	SLURM Operation on Cray XT and XE systems<br>
	Morris Jette (SchedMD)<br><br>
	SLURM version 2.3 supports Cray XT and XE systems running over Cray's ALPS
	(Application Level Placement Scheduler) resource manager. This presentation 
	will discuss the design and operation of SLURM with respect to Cray systems.

	<h2>Session #6</h2>
	Introduction to SLURM DRMAA<br>
	Mariusz Mamo&#324;ski (Pozna&#324; University)<br><br>
	DRMAA or Distributed Resource Management Application API is a high-level
	Open Grid Forum API specification for the submission and control of jobs
	in a Grid architecture.

	<h2>Session #7</h2>
	Bright Cluster Manager & SLURM: Benefits of Seamless Integration<br>
	Robert Stober, Sr. (Bright Computing)<br><br>
	Bright Cluster Manager, tightly integrated with SLURM, simplifies HPC
	cluster installation and management while boosting system throughput. Bright
	automatically installs, configures and deploys SLURM so that clusters are
	ready to use in minutes rather than days. Bright provides extensive and
	extensible monitoring and management through its intuitive Bright Cluster
	Manager GUI, powerful cluster management shell, and customizable web-based
	user portal.
	Additional integration benefits include sampling, analysis and visualization
	of all key SLURM metrics from within the Bright GUI, automatic head node
	failover, and extensive pre-job health checking capability. Regarding the
	latter, say good-bye to the black hole node syndrome: Bright plus SLURM
	effectively prevent this productivity-killing problem by identifying and
	sidelining problematic nodes before the job is run.

	<h2>Session #8</h2>
	Proposed Design for Job Step Management in User Space<br>
	Morris Jette (SchedMD)<br><br>
	SLURM currently creates and manages job steps using SLURM's control daemon,
	slurmctld. Since some user jobs create thousands of job steps, the management 
	of those job steps accounts for most of slurmctld's work. It is possible to 
	move job step management from slurmctld into user space to improve SLURM 
	scalability and performance. A possible implementation of this will be 
	presented.

	<h2>Session #9</h2>
	Proposed Design for Enhanced Enterprise-wide Scheduling<br>
	Don Lipari (LLNL)<br><br>
	SLURM currently supports the ability to submit and status jobs between
	computers at site, however the current design has some limitations. When a job
	is submitted with several possible computers usable for its execution, the
	job is routed to the computer on which it is expected to start earliest.
	Changes in the workload or system failures could make moving the job to another
	computer result in faster initiation, but that is currently impossible. SLURM
	is also unable to support dependencies between jobs executing on different
	computers. The design of a SLURM meta-scheduler with enhanced enterprise-wide
	scheduling capabilities will be presented.

	<h2>Session #10</h2>
	Contents of SLURM Version 2.3 and plans for future releases<br>
	Danny Auble and Morris Jette (SchedMD)<br><br>
	An overview of the changes SLURM Version 2.3 will be presented along with 
	current plans for future releases.

	<h2>Open Discussion</h2>
	All meeting attendees will be invited to provide input with respect to 
	SLURM's design and development work.
	We also invite proposals for hosting the SLURM User Group Meeting in 2012.
