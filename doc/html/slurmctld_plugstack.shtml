<h1><a name="top">Slurmctld Generic Plugin Programmer Guide</a></h1>

<h2> Overview</h2>

<p> This document describes slurmctld daemon's generic plugins and the API that
defines them. It is intended as a resource to programmers wishing to write
their own slurmctld generic plugins. This is version 100 of the API.

<p>The slurmctld generic plugin must conform to the
Slurm Plugin API with the following specifications:

<p><span class="commandline">const char
plugin_name[]="<i>full&nbsp;text&nbsp;name</i>"</span>
<p style="margin-left:.2in">
A free-formatted ASCII text string that identifies the plugin.

<p><span class="commandline">const char
plugin_type[]="<i>major/minor</i>"</span><br>
<p style="margin-left:.2in">
The major type must be &quot;slurmctld_plugstack.&quot;
The minor type can be any suitable name for the type of slurmctld package.
Slurm can be configured to use multiple slurmctld_plugstack plugins if desired.</p>

<p><span class="commandline">const uint32_t plugin_version</span><br>
If specified, identifies the version of Slurm used to build this plugin and
any attempt to load the plugin from a different version of Slurm will result
in an error.
If not specified, then the plugin may be loaded by Slurm commands and
daemons from any version, however this may result in difficult to diagnose
failures due to changes in the arguments to plugin functions or changes
in other Slurm functions used by the plugin.</p>

<h2>API Functions</h2>

<p class="commandline"> int init (void)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when the plugin is loaded, before any other functions are
  called. Put global initialization here.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br>
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or<br>
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure.</p>

<p class="commandline"> void fini (void)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when the plugin is removed. Clear any allocated storage here.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: None.</p>

<p class="commandline"> List slurmctld_plugstack_p_get_config (void)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when there's a REQUEST_BUILD_INFO RPC call. It must fill a List with
  config_key_pair_t elements that represents the configurable parameters of
  the plugin.
  Normally used when for scontrol and sview to dump the configuration.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br>
  List of keyword - value pairs.

<p><b>Note</b>: These init and fini functions are not the same as those
described in the <span class="commandline">dlopen (3)</span> system library.
The C run-time system co-opts those symbols for its own initialization.
The system <span class="commandline">_init()</span> is called before the Slurm
<span class="commandline">init()</span>, and the Slurm
<span class="commandline">fini()</span> is called before the system's
<span class="commandline">_fini()</span>.</p>

<p>The init function will be called when the slurmctld daemon begins accepting RPCs.
The fini function will be called when the slurmctld daemon stops accepting RPCs.
Other functions can be called at any time.
In the case of the backup slurmctld daemon, the init and fini functions may
be called multiple times (when it assumes control functions and then when it
relinquishes them to the primary slurmctld daemon).</p>
