<H1>Preemption</H1>

<P>
SLURM supports job preemption, the act of stopping one or more "low-priority"
jobs to let a "high-priority" job run uninterrupted until it completes.
Job preemption is implemented as a variation of SLURM's
<a href="gang_scheduling.html">Gang Scheduling</a> logic.
When a high-priority job has been allocated resources that have already been
allocated to one or more low priority jobs, the low priority job(s) are
preempted.
The low priority job(s) can resume once the high priority job completes.
Alternately, the low priority job(s) can be requeued and started using other
resources if so configured in newer versions of SLURM.
</P>
<P>
In SLURM version 2.0 and earlier, high priority work is identified by the
priority of the job's partition and low priority jobs are always suspended.
The job preemption logic is within the <I>sched/gang</I> plugin.
In SLURM version 2.1 and higher, the job's partition priority or its
Quality Of Service (QOS) can be used to identify the which jobs can preempt
or be preempted by other jobs.
</P>
<P>
SLURM version 2.1 offers several options for the job preemption mechanism
including checkpoint, requeue, or cancel.
the option of requeuing low priority jobs
Checkpointed jobs are not automatically requeued or restarted.
Requeued jobs may restart faster by using different resources.
All of these new job preemption mechanisms release a job's memory space for
use by other jobs.
In SLURM version 2.1, some job preemption logic was moved into the
<I>select</I> plugin and main code base to permit use of both job preemption
plus the backfill scheduler plugin, <i>sched/backfill</I>.
</P>

<P>
SLURM version 2.2 offers the ability to configure the preemption mechanism
used on a per partition or per QOS basis.
For example, jobs in a low priority queue may get requeued,
while jobs in a medium priority queue may get suspended.
</P>
<H2>Configuration</H2>
<P>
There are several important configuration parameters relating to preemption:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>SelectType</B>: SLURM job preemption logic supports nodes allocated by the
<I>select/linear</I> plugin and socket/core/CPU resources allocated by the
<I>select/cons_res</I> plugin.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>SelectTypeParameter</B>: Since resources may be getting over-allocated
with jobs (suspended jobs remain in memory), the resource selection
plugin should be configured to track the amount of memory used by each job to
ensure that memory page swapping does not occur. When <I>select/linear</I> is
chosen, we recommend setting <I>SelectTypeParameter=CR_Memory</I>. When
<I>select/cons_res</I> is chosen, we recommend including Memory as a resource
(ex. <I>SelectTypeParameter=CR_Core_Memory</I>).
<BR><B>NOTE:</B> Unless <I>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</I> these memory management
parameters are not critical.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>DefMemPerCPU</B>: Since job requests may not explicitly specify
a memory requirement, we also recommend configuring
<I>DefMemPerCPU</I> (default memory per allocated CPU) or
<I>DefMemPerNode</I> (default memory per allocated node).
It may also be desirable to configure
<I>MaxMemPerCPU</I> (maximum memory per allocated CPU) or
<I>MaxMemPerNode</I> (maximum memory per allocated node) in <I>slurm.conf</I>.
Users can use the <I>--mem</I> or <I>--mem-per-cpu</I> option
at job submission time to specify their memory requirements.
<BR><B>NOTE:</B> Unless <I>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</I> these memory management
parameters are not critical.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>GraceTime</B>: Specifies a time period for a job to execute after
it is selected to be preempted. This option can be specified by partition or
QOS using the <I>slurm.conf</I> file or database respectively. This option is
only honored if <I>PreemptMode=CANCEL</I>. The <I>GraceTime</I> is specified in
seconds and the default value is zero, which results in no preemption delay.
Once a job has been selected for preemption, it's end time is set to the
current time plus <I>GraceTime</I> and the mechanism used to terminate jobs
upon reaching their time limit is used to cancel the job.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>JobAcctGatherType and JobAcctGatherFrequency</B>: The "maximum data segment
size" and "maximum virtual memory size" system limits will be configured for
each job to ensure that the job does not exceed its requested amount of memory.
If you wish to enable additional enforcement of memory limits, configure job
accounting with the <I>JobAcctGatherType</I> and <I>JobAcctGatherFrequency</I>
parameters. When accounting is enabled and a job exceeds its configured memory
limits, it will be canceled in order to prevent it from adversely effecting
other jobs sharing the same resources.
<BR><B>NOTE:</B> Unless <I>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</I> these memory management
parameters are not critical.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>PreemptMode</B>: Specifies the mechanism used to preempt low priority jobs.
The PreemptMode should be specified for the cluster as a whole, although
different values can be configured on each partition when
<I>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</I>. Note that when specified 
on a partition, a compatible mode must also be specified system-wide;
specifically if a PreemptMode is set to SUSPEND for any partition, then
the system-wide PreemptMode must include the GANG parameter so the module
responsible for resuming jobs executes.
Configure to <I>CANCEL</I>, <I>CHECKPOINT</I>,
<I>SUSPEND</I> or <I>REQUEUE</I> depending on the desired action for low
priority jobs.
The <I>GANG</I> option must also be specified if gang scheduling is desired
or a PreemptMode of <I>SUSPEND</I> is used for any jobs.
<UL>
<LI>A value of <I>CANCEL</I> will always cancel the job.</LI>
<LI>A value of <I>CHECKPOINT</I> will checkpoint (if possible) or kill low
priority jobs.</LI>
Checkpointed jobs are not automatically restarted.
<LI>A value of <I>REQUEUE</I> will requeue (if possible) or kill low priority
jobs. Requeued jobs are permitted to be restarted on different resources.</LI>
<LI>A value of <I>SUSPEND</I> will suspend and automatically resume the low
priority jobs. The <I>SUSPEND</I> option must be used with the <I>GANG</I>
option (e.g. "PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG") and with
<I>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</I> (the logic to suspend and resume
jobs currently only has the data structures to support partitions).</LI>
<LI>A value of <I>GANG</I> may be used with any of the above values and will
execute a module responsible for resuming jobs previously suspended for either
gang scheduling or job preemption with suspension.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>
<B>PreemptType</B>: Configure to the desired mechanism used to identify
which jobs can preempt other jobs.
<UL>
<LI><I>preempt/none</I> indicates that jobs will not preempt each other
(default).</LI>
<LI><I>preempt/partition_prio</I> indicates that jobs from one partition
can preempt jobs from lower priority partitions.</LI>
<LI><I>preempt/qos</I> indicates that jobs from one Quality Of Service (QOS)
can preempt jobs from a lower QOS. These jobs can be in the same partition
or different partitions. PreemptMode must be set to CANCEL, CHECKPOINT,
or REQUEUE. This option requires the use of a database identifying
available QOS and their preemption rules. This option is not compatible with
PreemptMode=OFF or PreemptMode=SUSPEND (i.e. preempted jobs must be removed
from the resources).</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>
<B>Priority</B>: Configure the partition's <I>Priority</I> setting relative to
other partitions to control the preemptive behavior when
<I>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</I>.
This option is not relevant if <I>PreemptType=preempt/qos</I>.
If two jobs from two
different partitions are allocated to the same resources, the job in the
partition with the greater <I>Priority</I> value will preempt the job in the
partition with the lesser <I>Priority</I> value. If the <I>Priority</I> values
of the two partitions are equal then no preemption will occur. The default
<I>Priority</I> value is 1.
<BR><B>NOTE:</B> Unless <I>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</I> the
partition <I>Priority</I> is not critical.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>Shared</B>: Configure the partition's <I>Shared</I> setting to
<I>FORCE</I> for all partitions in which job preemption using a suspend/resume
mechanism is used or <I>NO</I> otherwise.
The <I>FORCE</I> option supports an additional parameter that controls
how many jobs can share a resource (FORCE[:max_share]). By default the
max_share value is 4. In order to preempt jobs (and not gang schedule them),
always set max_share to 1. To allow up to 2 jobs from this partition to be
allocated to a common resource (and gang scheduled), set
<I>Shared=FORCE:2</I>.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
To enable preemption after making the configuration changes described above,
restart SLURM if it is already running. Any change to the plugin settings in
SLURM requires a full restart of the daemons. If you just change the partition
<I>Priority</I> or <I>Shared</I> setting, this can be updated with
<I>scontrol reconfig</I>.
</P>

<H2>Preemption Design and Operation</H2>

<P>
The select plugin will identify resources where a pending job can begin
execution.
When <I>PreemptMode</I> is configured to CANCEL, CHECKPOINT, SUSPEND or
REQUEUE, the select plugin will also preempt running jobs as needed to
initiate the pending job.
When <I>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</I> the select plugin will initiate the
pending job and rely upon the gang scheduling logic to perform job suspend
and resume as described below.
</P>
<P>
When enabled, the gang scheduling logic (which is also supports job
preemption) keeps track of the resources allocated to all jobs.
For each partition an "active bitmap" is maintained that tracks all
concurrently running jobs in the SLURM cluster.
Each partition also maintains a job list for that partition, and a list of
"shadow" jobs.
The "shadow" jobs are high priority job allocations that "cast shadows" on the
active bitmaps of the low priority jobs.
Jobs caught in these "shadows" will be preempted.
</P>
<P>
Each time a new job is allocated to resources in a partition and begins
running, the gang scheduler adds a "shadow" of this job to all lower priority
partitions.
The active bitmap of these lower priority partitions are then rebuilt, with the shadow jobs added first.
Any existing jobs that were replaced by one or more "shadow" jobs are
suspended (preempted). Conversely, when a high priority running job completes,
it's "shadow" goes away and the active bitmaps of the lower priority
partitions are rebuilt to see if any suspended jobs can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The gang scheduler plugin is designed to be <I>reactive</I> to the resource
allocation decisions made by the "select" plugins.
The "select" plugins have been enhanced to recognize when job preemption has
been configured, and to factor in the priority of each partition when selecting resources for a job.
When choosing resources for each job, the selector avoids resources that are
in use by other jobs (unless sharing has been configured, in which case it
does some load-balancing).
However, when job preemption is enabled, the select plugins may choose
resources that are already in use by jobs from partitions with a lower
priority setting, even when sharing is disabled in those partitions.
</P>
<P>
This leaves the gang scheduler in charge of controlling which jobs should run
on the over-allocated resources.
If <I>PreemptMode=SUSPEND</I>, jobs are suspended using the same internal
functions that support <I>scontrol suspend</I> and <I>scontrol resume</I>.
A good way to observe the operation of the gang scheduler is by running
<I>squeue -i&lt;time&gt;</I> in a terminal window.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="future_work">Future Ideas</A></H2>

<P>
<B>More intelligence in the select plugins</B>: This implementation of
preemption relies on intelligent job placement by the <I>select</I> plugins.
In SLURM version 2.0 preemptive placement support was added to the
SelectType plugins, but there is still room for improvement.
</P><P>
Take the following example:
</P>
<PRE>
[user@n8 ~]$ <B>sinfo</B>

hipri        up   infinite     2   idle n[4-5]
</PRE>
<P>
It would be more ideal if the "hipri" job were placed on nodes n[3-5], which
would allow jobs 17 and 18 to continue running. However, a new "intelligent"
algorithm would have to include factors such as job size and required nodes in
order to support ideal placements such as this, which can quickly complicate
the design. Any and all help is welcome here!
