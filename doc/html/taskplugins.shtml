<h1><a name="top">Slurm Task Plugin Programmer Guide</a></h1>

<h2> Overview</h2>
<p> This document describes Slurm task management plugins and the API
that defines them. It is intended as a resource to programmers wishing
to write their own Slurm scheduler plugins.</p>

<p>Slurm task management plugins are Slurm plugins that implement the
Slurm task management API described herein. They would typically be
used to control task affinity (i.e. binding tasks to processors).
They must conform to the Slurm Plugin API with the following
specifications:</p>
<p><span class="commandline">const char plugin_type[]</span><br>
The major type must be &quot;task.&quot; The minor type can be any recognizable
abbreviation for the type of task management. We recommend, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>affinity</b> &mdash; A plugin that implements task binding to processors.
The actual mechanism used to task binding is dependent upon the available
infrastructure as determined by the "configure" program when Slurm is built
and the value of the <b>TaskPluginParam</b> as defined in the <b>slurm.conf</b>
(Slurm configuration file).</li>
<li><b>cgroup</b> &mdash; Use Linux cgroups for binding tasks to resources.</li>
<li><b>none</b> &mdash; A plugin that implements the API without providing any
services. This is the default behavior and provides no task binding.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="commandline">const char plugin_name[]</span><br>
Some descriptive name for the plugin.
There is no requirement with respect to its format.</p>
<p><span class="commandline">const uint32_t plugin_version</span><br>
If specified, identifies the version of Slurm used to build this plugin and
any attempt to load the plugin from a different version of Slurm will result
in an error.
If not specified, then the plugin may be loadeed by Slurm commands and
daemons from any version, however this may result in difficult to diagnose
failures due to changes in the arguments to plugin functions or changes
in other Slurm functions used by the plugin.</p>

<h2>Data Objects</h2>
<p>The implementation must maintain (though not necessarily directly export) an
enumerated <span class="commandline">errno</span>  to allow Slurm to discover
as practically as possible the reason for any failed API call.
These values must not be used as return values in integer-valued functions
in the API. The proper error return value from integer-valued functions is
SLURM_ERROR.</p>
<p class="footer"><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h2>API Functions</h2>
<p>The following functions must appear. Functions which are not implemented should
be stubbed.</p>

<p class="commandline"> int init (void)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when the plugin is loaded, before any other functions are
  called. Put global initialization here.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br>
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or<br>
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure.</p>

<p class="commandline"> void fini (void)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when the plugin is removed. Clear any allocated storage here.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: None.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: These init and fini functions are not the same as those
described in the <span class="commandline">dlopen (3)</span> system library.
The C run-time system co-opts those symbols for its own initialization.
The system <span class="commandline">_init()</span> is called before the Slurm
<span class="commandline">init()</span>, and the Slurm
<span class="commandline">fini()</span> is called before the system's
<span class="commandline">_fini()</span>.</p>
