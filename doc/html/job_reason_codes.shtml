<h1>Job Reason Codes</h1>

<p>These reason codes can be used to identify why a pending job has not yet been
started by the scheduler. There may be multiple reasons why a job cannot start,
in which case only the reason that was encountered by the attempted scheduling
method will be displayed. Refer to the <a href="sched_config.html">
Scheduling Configuration Guide</a> for more details.</p>
