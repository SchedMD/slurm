<h1>Platforms</h1>
<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>AIX</b>&#151;Slurm support for AIX has been thoroughly tested, but we
know of no AIX installations using Slurm after 2008. See
<a href="ibm.html">IBM AIX User and Administrator Guide</a> for more information.</li>
<li><b>Linux</b>&#151;Slurm has been thoroughly tested on most popular Linux
distributions using i386, ia64, and x86_64 architectures.</li>
<li><b>OS X</b>&#151;Slurm has run OS X in the past, but the current OS X linker
does not support Slurm plugins. (OS X dynamically linked objects can be called by
the main program. They may not call functions in the main program or other
dynamically linked objects, which are features required by Slurm.)</li>
<li><b>Solaris</b>&#151;Slurm support for Solaris (OpenSolaris build 119) was
added in version 2.1.</li>
<li><b>Other</b>&#151;Slurm ports to other systems will be gratefully accepted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interconnects</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>BlueGene</b>&#151;Slurm support for IBM's BlueGene/L, BlueGene/P and
BlueGene/Q systems has been thoroughly tested. See
<a href="bluegene.html">Blue Gene User and Administrator Guide</a>
for more information.</li>
<li><b>Cray XT and XE</b>&#151;Operates as a scheduler on top of Cray's
ALPS/BASIL software. Supported added in Slurm version 2.3. Note that Cray's
ALPS/BASIL software necessitates some changes in Slurm behavior. See
<a href="cray.html">Cray User and Administrator Guide</a> for more information.</li>
<li><b>Ethernet</b>&#151;Ethernet requires no special support from Slurm and has
been thoroughly tested.</li>
<li><b>IBM Infiniband/Torrent</b>&#151;Slurm supports IBM's NRT (Network
Resource Table) interface and
<a href="ibm-pe.html">IBM's PE (Parallel Environment)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Infiniband</b>&#151;Infiniband support has been thoroughly tested.</li>
<li><b>Myrinet</b>&#151;Myrinet, MPICH-GM and MPICH-MX are supported.</li>
<li><b>Quadrics Elan</b>&#151;Slurm support for Quadrics Elan 3 and Elan 4 switches
are available in all versions of Slurm and have been thoroughly tested.</li>
<li><b>Sun Constellation</b>&#151;Resource allocation has been optimized
for the three-dimensional torus interconnect.</li>
<li><b>Other</b>&#151;Slurm ports to other systems will be gratefully accepted.</li>
</ul>
