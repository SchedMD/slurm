<h1>Resource Limits</h1>

<p>Familiarity with Slurm's <a href="accounting.html">Accounting</a> web page
is strongly recommended before use of this document.</p>

<h2 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy<a class="slurm_link" href="#hierarchy"></a></h2>

<p>Slurm's hierarchical limits are enforced in the following order
  with Job QOS and Partition QOS order being reversible by using the QOS
  flag 'OverPartQOS':</p>
<ol>
	<li>Partition QOS limit</li>
	<li>Job QOS limit</li>
	<li>User association</li>
	<li>Account association(s), ascending the hierarchy</li>
	<li>Root/Cluster association</li>
	<li>Partition limit</li>
	<li>None</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: If limits are defined at multiple points in this hierarchy,
the point in this list where the limit is first defined will be used.
Consider the following example:</p>
<ul>
<li>MaxJobs=20 and MaxSubmitJobs is undefined in the partition QOS</li>
<li>No limits are set in the job QOS and</li>
<li>MaxJobs=4 and MaxSubmitJobs=50 in the user association</li>
</ul>
<p>The limits in effect will be MaxJobs=20 and MaxSubmitJobs=50.</p>

<p>Note: The precedence order specified above is respected except for the
following limits: Max[Time|Wall], [Min|Max]Nodes. For these limits, even
if the job is enforced with QOS and/or Association limits, it can't
go over the limit imposed at Partition level, even if it listed at the bottom.
So the default for these 3 types of limits is that they are upper bound by the
Partition one. This Partition level bound can be ignored if
the respective QOS PartitionTimeLimit and/or Partition[Max|Min]Nodes flags
are set, then the job would be enforced the limits imposed at QOS
and/or association level respecting the order above.
<b>Grp*</b> limits are also an exception. A more restrictive limit at the
Account level will be enforced before a less restrictive limit at the User
level. This is due to the nature of the limit being enforced, requiring that
the limit at the highest level not be exceeded.
</p>

<h2 id="config">Configuration<a class="slurm_link" href="#config"></a></h2>

<p>Scheduling policy information must be stored in a database
as specified by the <b>AccountingStorageType</b> configuration parameter
in the <b>slurm.conf</b> configuration file.
Information can be recorded in a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or
<a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a> database.
For security and performance reasons, the use of
SlurmDBD (Slurm Database Daemon) as a front-end to the
database is strongly recommended.
SlurmDBD uses a Slurm authentication plugin (e.g. MUNGE).
SlurmDBD also uses an existing Slurm accounting storage plugin
to maximize code reuse.
SlurmDBD uses data caching and prioritization of pending requests
in order to optimize performance.
While SlurmDBD relies upon existing Slurm plugins for authentication
and database use, the other Slurm commands and daemons are not required
on the host where SlurmDBD is installed.
Only the <i>slurmdbd</i> and <i>slurm-plugins</i> RPMs are required
for SlurmDBD execution.</p>

<p>Both accounting and scheduling policies are configured based upon
an <i>association</i>. An <i>association</i> is a 4-tuple consisting
of the cluster name, bank account, user and (optionally) the Slurm
partition.
In order to enforce scheduling policy, set the value of
<b>AccountingStorageEnforce</b>.
This option contains a comma separated list of options you may want to
enforce.  The valid options are:
<ul>
<li>associations - This will prevent users from running jobs if
their <i>association</i> is not in the database. This option will
prevent users from accessing invalid accounts.
</li>
<li>limits - This will enforce limits set to associations.  By setting
  this option, the 'associations' option is also set.
</li>
<li>qos - This will require all jobs to specify (either overtly or by
default) a valid qos (Quality of Service).  QOS values are defined for
each association in the database.  By setting this option, the
'associations' option is also set.
</li>
<li>safe - This will ensure a job will only be launched when using an
  association or qos that has a TRES-minutes limit set if the job will be
  able to run to completion. Without this option set, jobs will be
  launched as long as their usage hasn't reached the TRES-minutes limit
  which can lead to jobs being launched but then killed when the limit is
  reached.
  With the 'safe' option set, a job won't be killed due to limits,
  even if the limits are changed after the job was started and the
  association or qos violates the updated limits.
  By setting this option, both the 'associations' option and the
  'limits' option are set automatically.
</li>
<li>wckeys - This will prevent users from running jobs under a wckey
  that they don't have access to.  By using this option, the
  'associations' option is also set.  The 'TrackWCKey' option is also
  set to true.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: The association is a combination of cluster, account,
user names and optional partition name.
<br>
Without AccountingStorageEnforce being set (the default behavior)
jobs will be executed based upon policies configured in Slurm on each
cluster.
</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools<a class="slurm_link" href="#tools"></a></h2>

<p>The tool used to manage accounting policy is <i>sacctmgr</i>.
It can be used to create and delete cluster, user, bank account,
and partition records plus their combined <i>association</i> record.
See <i>man sacctmgr</i> for details on this tools and examples of
its use.</p>

<p>Changes made to the scheduling policy are uploaded to
the Slurm control daemons on the various clusters and take effect
immediately. When an association is deleted, all running or pending
jobs which belong to that association are immediately canceled.
When limits are lowered, running jobs will not be canceled to
satisfy the new limits, but the new lower limits will be enforced.</p>

<h2 id="limits">Association specific limits and scheduling policies
<a class="slurm_link" href="#assoc"></a>
</h2>
<p>These represent the limits and scheduling policies relevant to Associations.
When dealing with Associations, most of these limits are available
not only for the user association, but also for each cluster and account.
Limits and policies are applied in the following order:
<br>
1. The option specified for the user association.
<br>
2. The option specified for the account.
<br>
3. The option specified for the cluster.
<br>
4. If nothing is configured at the above levels, no limit will be applied.
</p>

<p>These are just the limits and policies for Associations. For a more
complete description of the columns available to be displayed, see the
<a href="sacctmgr.html#SECTION_LIST/SHOW-ASSOCIATION-FORMAT-OPTIONS">
sacctmgr</a> man page.</p>

<dd>Integer value used for determining priority.
  Essentially this is the amount of claim this association and its
  children have to the above system. Can also be the string "parent",
  when used on a user this means that the parent association is used
  for fairshare.  If Fairshare=parent is set on an account, that
  account's children will be effectively re-parented for fairshare
  calculations to the first parent of their parent that is not
  Fairshare=parent.  Limits remain the same, only its fairshare value

<p>Unless noted, if a job request breaches a given limit
on its own, the job will pend unless the job's QOS has the DenyOnLimit

<p>The <b>MaxNodes</b> and <b>MaxTime</b> options already exist in
Slurm's configuration on a per-partition basis, but the above options
provide the ability to impose limits on a per-user basis.  The
<b>MaxJobs</b> option provides an entirely new mechanism for Slurm to
control the workload any individual may place on a cluster in order to
achieve some balance between users.</p>

<p>When assigning limits to a QOS to use for a Partition QOS,
keep in mind that those limits are enforced at the QOS level, not
individually for each partition.  For example, if a QOS has a
<b>GrpTRES=cpu=20</b> limit defined and the QOS is assigned to two
unique partitions, users will be limited to 20 CPUs for the QOS
rather than being allowed 20 CPUs for each partition.</p>

<p>Fair-share scheduling is based upon the hierarchical bank account
data maintained in the Slurm database.  More information can be found
in the <a href="priority_multifactor.html">priority/multifactor</a>
plugin description.</p>

<h3 id="gres_limits">Specific limits over GRES
<a class="slurm_link" href="#gres_limits"></a>
</h3>
<p> When a GRES has a type associated with it and a limit is applied
  over this specific type (e.g. <i>MaxTRESPerUser=gres/gpu:tesla=1</i>) if a
  user requests a generic gres, the type's limit will not be enforced. In this
  situation an additional lua job submit plugin to check the user request may
  become useful. For example, if one requests <i>--gres=gpu:2</i> having a
  limit set of <i>MaxTRESPerUser=gres/gpu:tesla=1</i>, the limit won't be
  enforced so it will still be possible to get two teslas.
</p>
<p>
  This is due to a design limitation. The only way to enforce such a limit
  is to combine the specification of the limit with a job submit plugin that
  forces the user to always request a specific type model.
</p>
<p>
  An example of basic lua job submit plugin function could be:
</p>
<pre>
function slurm_job_submit(job_desc, part_list, submit_uid)
   gres_request = ""
   t = {job_desc.tres_per_job,
	job_desc.tres_per_socket,
	job_desc.tres_per_task,
	job_desc.tres_per_node}
   for k in pairs(t) do
	gres_request = gres_request .. t[k] .. ","
   end
   if (gres_request ~= nil)
   then
      for g in gres_request:gmatch("[^,]+")
      do
	 bad = string.match(g,'^gres/gpu[:=]*[0-9]*$')
	 if (bad ~= nil)
	 then
	    slurm.log_info("User specified gpu GRES without type: %s", bad)
	    slurm.user_msg("You must always specify a type when requesting gpu GRES")
	    return slurm.ERROR
	 end
      end
   end
end
</pre>
<p> Having this script and the limit in place will force the users to always
  specify a gpu with its type, thus enforcing the limits for each specific
  model.
</p>

<p>When <b>TRESBillingWeights</b> are defined for a partition, both typed and
non-typed resources should be included. For example, if you have 'tesla' GPUs
in one partition and you only define the billing weights for the 'tesla' typed
GPU resource, then those weights will not be applied to the generic GPUs.</p>

<p>It is also advisable to set <b>AccountingStorageTRES</b> for both generic
  and specific gres types, otherwise requests that ask for the generic instance
  of a gres won't be accounted for. For example, to track generic GPUs and
  Tesla GPUs, you would set this in your slurm.conf:
</p>
<pre>
  AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu,gres/gpu:tesla
</pre>

<p>
  See <a href="tres.html">Trackable Resources TRES</a> for details.

<p>When a pending job is evaluated by the scheduler but found to exceed a
configured resource limit, a corresponding reason will be assigned to the job.
More details can be found on the <a href="job_reason_codes.html">Job Reason
Codes</a> page. More details about scheduling can be found in the
<a href="sched_config.html"> Scheduling Configuration Guide</a>.</p>
