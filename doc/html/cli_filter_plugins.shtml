<h1><a name="top">cli_filter Plugin API</a></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This document describes Slurm cli_filter plugins and the API that
defines them. It is intended as a resource to programmers wishing to write
their own Slurm cli_filter plugins.</p>

<p> The purpose of the cli_filter plugins is to provide programmatic hooks
during the execution of the <b>salloc</b>, <b>sbatch</b>, and <b>srun</b>
command line interface (CLI) programs. Three hooks are defined:
<ul>
<li><b>setup_defaults</b> &mdash; Called before any option processing is done,
<i>per job component</i>, allowing a plugin to replace default option
values.</li>
<li><b>pre_submit</b> &mdash; Called after option processing <i>per job
component</i> but before any communication
is made with the slurm controller. This location
is ideal for policy enforcement because the plugin can read all the options
supplied by the user (as well as the environment) - thus invalid job requests
can be stopped before they ever reach the slurmctld.</li>
<li><b>post_submit</b> &mdash; Called after the jobid (and, in the case of
<b>srun</b>, after the stepid) is generated, and typically before or in
parallel with job execution.  In combination with data collected in the
pre_submit() hook, this is an ideal location for logging activity.</li>
</p>

<p>
cli_filter plugins vary from the <a href="job_submit_plugins.html">job_submit
plugin</a> as it is entirely executed client-side, whereas job_submit is
processed server-side (within the slurm controller). The benefit of the
cli_filter is that it has access to all command line options in a simple and
consistent interface as well as being safer to run disruptive operations
(e.g., quota checks or other long running operations you might want to use
for integrating policy decisions), which can be problematic if run from the
controller. The disadvantage of the cli_filter is that it must not be relied
upon for security purposes as an enterprising user can circumvent it simply
by providing loading an alternate slurm.conf with the CliFilterPlugins option
disabled. If you plan to use the cli_filter for managing policies, you should
also configure a job_submit plugin to reinforce those policies.</p>

<p>Slurm cli_filter plugins must conform to the
Slurm Plugin API with the following specifications:</p>

<p><span class="commandline">const char
plugin_name[]="<i>full&nbsp;text&nbsp;name</i>"</span>
<p style="margin-left:.2in">
A free-formatted ASCII text string that identifies the plugin.

<p><span class="commandline">const char
plugin_type[]="<i>major/minor</i>"</span><br>
<p style="margin-left:.2in">
The major type must be &quot;cli_filter.&quot;
The minor type can be any suitable name for the type of job submission package.
We include samples in the Slurm distribution for
<ul>
<li><b>none</b> &mdash; An empty plugin with no actions taken, a useful starting
template for a new plugin.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="commandline">const uint32_t plugin_version</span><br>
If specified, identifies the version of Slurm used to build this plugin and
any attempt to load the plugin from a different version of Slurm will result
in an error.
If not specified, then the plugin may be loaded by Slurm commands and
daemons from any version, however this may result in difficult to diagnose
failures due to changes in the arguments to plugin functions or changes
in other Slurm functions used by the plugin.</p>

<p>Slurm can be configured to use multiple cli_filter plugins if desired,
however the lua plugin will only execute one lua script named "cli_filter.lua"
located in the default script directory (typically the subdirectory "etc" of
the installation directory).</p>


<h2>API Functions</h2>
<p>All of the following functions are required. Functions which are not
implemented must be stubbed.

<p class="commandline">int init(void)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when the plugin is loaded, before any other functions are
  called. Put global initialization here.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br>
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or<br>
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure.</p>

<p class="commandline">void fini(void)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
  Called when the plugin is removed. Clear any allocated storage here.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: None.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: These init and fini functions are not the same as those
described in the <span class="commandline">dlopen (3)</span> system library.
The C run-time system co-opts those symbols for its own initialization.
The system <span class="commandline">_init()</span> is called before the Slurm
<span class="commandline">init()</span>, and the Slurm
<span class="commandline">fini()</span> is called before the system's
<span class="commandline">_fini()</span>.</p>

<p class="commandline">int setup_defaults(slurm_opt_t *options, bool early)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
This function is called by the salloc, sbatch, or srun command line interface
(CLI) programs shortly before processing any options from the environment,
command line, or script (#SBATCH). The hook may be run multiple times per job
component, once for an early pass (if implemented by the CLI), and again for
the main pass.
The options and early arguments are meant to be passed to <b>slurm_option_set()</b>
which will set the option if it is in the appropriate pass. Failures to set
an option may be a symptom of trying to set the option on the wrong pass. Given
that you should not return SLURM_ERROR simply because of a failure to set an option.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>: <br>
<span class="commandline">options</span>
(input) slurm option data structure; meant to be passed to the slurm_option_* API
within <i>src/common/slurm_opt.h</i>.<br>
<span class="commandline">early</span>
(input) boolean indicating if this is the early pass or not; meant to be passed to
the slurm_option_* API within <i>src/common/slurm_opt.h</i>.<br>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br>
<span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or<br>
<span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure, will terminate execution
of the CLI.

<p class="commandline">int pre_submit(slurm_opt_t *options, int offset)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
This function is called by the CLI after option processing but before any
communication with the slurmctld is made.  This is after all setup_defaults()
hooks are executed (for the current job component), environment variables
processed, command line options and #SBATCH directives interpreted.
<b>pre_submit()</b> is called before any parts of
the data structure are rewritten, so it is safe to
both read and write or unset any options from the plugin that you desire.
Note that post_submit() cannot safely read (or write) the options, so you should
save any state for logging in post_submit() during pre_submit(). This function is
called once per job component.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>: <br>
<span class="commandline">options</span>
(input/output) the job allocation request specifications.<br>
<span class="commandline">offset</span>
(input) integer value for the current hetjob offset; should be used as a key when
storing data for communication between pre_submit() and post_submit().<br>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: <br>
<span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or<br>
<span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure, will terminate execution
of the CLI.

<p class="commandline">void post_submit(int offset, uint32_t jobid, uint32_t stepid)
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>:<br>
This function is called by the CLI after a jobid (and, if srun, a stepid) has
been assigned by the controller.  It is no longer safe to read or write to the
options data structure, so it has been removed from this function.  You should
save any state you need in pre_submit() using het_job_offset as a key, since
the function is called separately for every job component, and access
it here.
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>: <br>
<span class="commandline">offset</span>
(input) integer value for the current hetjob offset; should be used as a key
when storing data for communication between pre_submit() and post_submit().<br>
<span class="commandline">jobid</span>
(input) job id of the job<br>
<span class="commandline">stepid</span>
(input) step id of the job if appropriate, NO_VAL otherwise<br>
