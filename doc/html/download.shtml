<li><b>SPANK Plugins</b><br>
SPANK provides a very generic interface for stackable plug-ins which
may be used to dynamically modify the job launch code in Slurm. SPANK
plugins may be built without access to Slurm source code. They need
only be compiled against Slurm&lsquo;s spank.h header file, added to the
SPANK config file plugstack.conf, and they will be loaded at runtime
during the next job launch. Thus, the SPANK infrastructure provides
administrators and other developers a low cost, low effort ability to
dynamically modify the runtime behavior of Slurm job launch.
As assortment of SPANK plugins are available from<br>
<a href="https://github.com/grondo/slurm-spank-plugins">

<dl>
<dt>pbs2sbatch</dt>
<dd>Converts PBS directives to equivalent Slurm sbatch directives. Accommodates
    old UB CCR-specific PBS tags like IB1, IB2, etc.</dd>
<dt>pbs2slurm</dt>
<dd>A script that attempts to convert PBS scripts into corresponding sbatch
    scripts. It will convert PBS directives as well as PBS environment variables
    and will insert bash code to create a SLURM_NODEFILE that is consistent with
    the PBS_NODEFILE.</dd>
<dt>slurmbf</dt>
<dd>Analogous to the PBS "showbf -S" command.</dd>
<dt>snodes</dt>
<dd>A customized version of sinfo. Displays node information in an
   easy-to-interpet format. Filters can be applied to view (1) specific nodes,
   (2) nodes in a specific partition, or (3) nodes in a specifc state.</dd>
<dt>sqstat</dt>
<dd>A customized version of squeue that produces output analogous to the PBS
    qstat and xqstat commands (requires clush).</dd>
<dt>fisbatch</dt>
<dd>Friendly Interactive sbatch. A customized version of sbatch that provides a
    user-friendly interface to an interactive job with X11 forwarding enabled.
    It is analogous to the PBS "qsub -I -X" command. This code was adopted from
    srun.x11 (requires clush).</dd>
<dt>sranks</dt>
<dd>A command that lists the overall priorities and associated priority
    components of queued jobs in ascending order. Top-ranked jobs will be given
    priority by the scheduler but lower ranked jobs may get slotted in first if
    they fit into the scheduler's backfill window.</dd>
<dt>sqelp</dt>
<dd>A customized version of squeue that only prints a double-quote if the
    information in a column is the same from row to row. Some users find this
    type of formatting easier to visually digest.</dd>
<dt>sjeff</dt>
<dd>Determines the efficiency of one or more running jobs. Inefficient jobs are
    high-lighted in red text (requires clush).</dd>
<dt>sueff</dt>
<dd>Determines the overall efficiency of the running jobs of one or more users.
    Users that are inefficient are highlighted in red text (requires clush).</dd>

<dd>Retrieves Slurm accounting information for a given node and for a given
    period of time.</dd>

<li><b>Slurmmon</b><br>
Slurmmon is a system for gathering and plotting data about Slurm scheduling and
job characteristics. It currently simply sends the data to ganglia, but it
includes some custom reports and a web page for an organized summary.
It collects all the data from sdiag as well as total counts of running and
pending jobs in the system and the maximum such values for any single user.
It can also submit probe jobs to various partitions in order to trend the
times spent pending in them, which is often a good bellwether of scheduling
problems.<br>

<li><b>Graphical Sdiag</b><br>
The sdiag utility is a diagnostic tool that maintains statistics on Slurm's
scheduling performance. You can run sdiag periodically or as you modify
Slurm's configuration. However if you want a historical view of these
statistics, you could save them in a time-series database and graph them over
time as performed with this tool:
