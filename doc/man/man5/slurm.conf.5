.SH "NAME"
slurm.conf \- Slurm configuration file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBslurm.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes general Slurm
configuration information, the nodes to be managed, information about
how those nodes are grouped into partitions, and various scheduling
parameters associated with those partitions. This file should be
consistent across all nodes in the cluster.
.LP
The file location can be modified at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The Slurm daemons also allow you to override
both the built\-in and environment\-provided location using the "\-f"
option on the command line.
.LP
The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes
and partitions. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
Changes to TCP listening settings will require a daemon restart.
.LP
If a line begins with the word "Include" followed by whitespace
and then a file name, that file will be included inline with the current
configuration file. For large or complex systems, multiple configuration files
may prove easier to manage and enable reuse of some files (See INCLUDE
MODIFIERS for more details).
.LP
Note on file permissions:
.LP
The \fIslurm.conf\fR file must be readable by all users of Slurm, since it
is used by many of the Slurm commands. Other files that are defined
in the \fIslurm.conf\fR file, such as log files and job accounting files,
may need to be created/owned by the user "SlurmUser" to be successfully
accessed. Use the "chown" and "chmod" commands to set the ownership
and permissions appropriately.
See the section \fBFILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS\fR for information
about the various files and directories used by Slurm.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.LP
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBAccountingStorageBackupHost\fR
The name of the backup machine hosting the accounting storage database.
If used with the accounting_storage/slurmdbd plugin, this is where the backup
slurmdbd would be running.
Only used with systems using SlurmDBD, ignored otherwise.
.IP

.IP

.TP
\fBassociations\fR
No new job is allowed to run unless a corresponding association exists in the
system.
.IP

.TP
\fBlimits\fR
Users can be limited by association to whatever job size or run time limits are
defined. Implies \fBassociations\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBnojobs\fR
Slurm will not account for any jobs or steps on the system.
Implies \fBnosteps\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBnosteps\fR
Slurm will not account for any steps that have run.
.IP

.TP
\fBqos\fR
Jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid qos is specified.
Implies \fBassociations\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBsafe\fR
A job will only be launched against an association or qos that has a
TRES\-minutes limit set if the job will be able to run to completion. Without
this option set, jobs will be launched as long as their usage hasn't reached
the TRES\-minutes limit. This can lead to jobs being launched but then killed
when the limit is reached. With this option, a job won't be killed due to limits,
even if the limits are changed after the job was started and the association or
qos violates the updated limits. Implies \fBlimits\fR and \fBassociations\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBwckeys\fR
Jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid workload characterization key is
specified. Implies \fBassociations\fR and \fBTrackWCKey\fR (a separate
configuration option).

.IP

.TP
\fBAccountingStorageExternalHost\fR
A comma\-separated list of external slurmdbds (<host/ip>[:port][,...]) to
register with. If no port is given, the \fBAccountingStoragePort\fR will be
used.

This allows clusters registered with the external slurmdbd to communicate with
each other using the \fI\-\-cluster/\-M\fR client command options.

The cluster will add itself to the external slurmdbd if it doesn't exist. If a
non\-external cluster already exists on the external slurmdbd, the slurmctld
will ignore registering to the external slurmdbd.
.IP

.TP
\fBAccountingStorageHost\fR
The name of the machine hosting the accounting storage database.
Only used with systems using SlurmDBD, ignored otherwise.

.RE
.IP

.TP
\fBAccountingStoragePass\fR
The password used to gain access to the database to store the
accounting data. Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored
otherwise. In the case of SlurmDBD (Database Daemon) with MUNGE
authentication this can be configured to use a MUNGE daemon
specifically configured to provide authentication between clusters
while the default MUNGE daemon provides authentication within a
cluster. In that case, \fBAccountingStoragePass\fR should specify the
named port to be used for communications with the alternate MUNGE
daemon (e.g. "/var/run/munge/global.socket.2"). The default value is
NULL.
.IP

.TP
\fBAccountingStoragePort\fR
The listening port of the accounting storage database server.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system
build time. If no value is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.
This value must be equal to the \fBDbdPort\fR parameter in the
slurmdbd.conf file.
.IP

.TP
\fBAccountingStorageTRES\fR
Comma\-separated list of resources you wish to track on the cluster.
These are the resources requested by the sbatch/srun job when it
is submitted. Currently this consists of any GRES, BB (burst buffer) or
license along with CPU, Memory, Node, Energy, FS/[Disk|Lustre], IC/OFED, Pages,
and VMem. By default Billing, CPU, Energy, Memory, Node, FS/Disk, Pages and VMem
are tracked. These default TRES cannot be disabled, but only appended to.
AccountingStorageTRES=gres/craynetwork,license/iop1
will track billing, cpu, energy, memory, nodes, fs/disk, pages and vmem along
with a gres called craynetwork as well as a license called iop1. Whenever these
resources are used on the cluster they are recorded. The TRES are automatically
set up in the database on the start of the slurmctld.

If multiple GRES of different types are tracked (e.g. GPUs of different types),
then job requests with matching type specifications will be recorded.
Given a configuration of
"AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu,gres/gpu:tesla,gres/gpu:volta"
Then "gres/gpu:tesla" and "gres/gpu:volta" will track only jobs that explicitly
request those two GPU types, while "gres/gpu" will track allocated GPUs of any
type ("tesla", "volta" or any other GPU type).

Given a configuration of
"AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu:tesla,gres/gpu:volta"
Then "gres/gpu:tesla" and "gres/gpu:volta" will track jobs that explicitly
request those GPU types.
If a job requests GPUs, but does not explicitly specify the GPU type, then
its resource allocation will be accounted for as either "gres/gpu:tesla" or
"gres/gpu:volta", although the accounting may not match the actual GPU type
allocated to the job and the GPUs allocated to the job could be heterogeneous.
In an environment containing various GPU types, use of a job_submit plugin
may be desired in order to force jobs to explicitly specify some GPU type.

\fBNOTE\fR: Setting gres/gpu will also set gres/gpumem and gres/gpuutil.
gres/gpumem and gres/gpuutil can be set individually when gres/gpu is not set.

\fBAcctGatherNodeFreq\fR
The AcctGather plugins sampling interval for node accounting.
For AcctGather plugin values of none, this parameter is ignored.
For all other values this parameter is the number
of seconds between node accounting samples. For the
acct_gather_energy/rapl plugin, set a value less
than 300 because the counters may overflow beyond this rate.
The default value is zero. This value disables accounting sampling
for nodes. Note: The accounting sampling interval for jobs is
determined by the value of \fBJobAcctGatherFrequency\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBAcctGatherEnergyType\fR
Identifies the plugin to be used for energy consumption accounting.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
energy consumption data for jobs and nodes. The collection of energy
consumption data takes place on the node level, hence only in case of exclusive
job allocation the energy consumption measurements will reflect the job's
real consumption. In case of node sharing between jobs the reported consumed
energy per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real energy
consumed by the jobs. Default is nothing is collected.

\fBAcctGatherInterconnectType\fR
Identifies the plugin to be used for interconnect network traffic accounting.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
network traffic data for jobs and nodes.
The collection of network traffic data takes place on the node level,
hence only in case of exclusive job allocation the collected values will
reflect the job's real traffic. In case of node sharing between jobs the reported
network traffic per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real
network traffic by the jobs.

Configurable values at present are:
.IP
.RS
.TP 20
\fBacct_gather_interconnect/ofed\fR
Infiniband network traffic data are collected from the hardware monitoring
counters of Infiniband devices through the OFED library.

\fBAcctGatherFilesystemType\fR
Identifies the plugin to be used for filesystem traffic accounting.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
filesystem traffic data for jobs and nodes.
The collection of filesystem traffic data takes place on the node level,
hence only in case of exclusive job allocation the collected values will
reflect the job's real traffic. In case of node sharing between jobs the reported
filesystem traffic per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real
filesystem traffic by the jobs.

\fIAccountingStorageTRES\fR.
.RE
.IP

.TP
\fBAcctGatherProfileType\fR
Identifies the plugin to be used for detailed job profiling.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
detailed data such as I/O counts, memory usage, or energy consumption for jobs
and nodes. There are interfaces in this plugin to collect data as step start
and completion, task start and completion, and at the account gather
frequency. The data collected at the node level is related to jobs only in
case of exclusive job allocation.

\fBAllowSpecResourcesUsage\fR
If set to "YES", Slurm allows individual jobs to override node's configured
CoreSpecCount value. For a job to take advantage of this feature,
a command line option of \-\-core\-spec must be specified. The default
value for this option is "YES" for Cray systems and "NO" for other system types.

\fBAuthAltTypes\fR
Comma\-separated list of alternative authentication plugins that the slurmctld
will permit for communication. Acceptable values at present include
\fBauth/jwt\fR.

\fBNOTE\fR: If \fBAuthAltParameters\fR is not used to specify a path to the
required jwt_hs256.key then slurmctld will default to looking for it in the
\fBStateSaveLocation\fR.
The jwt_hs256.key should only be visible to the SlurmUser and root. It is not
suggested to place the jwt_hs256.key on any nodes other than the machine running
\fBslurmctld\fR and the machine running \fBslurmdbd\fR.
\fBauth/jwt\fR can be activated by the presence of the \fISLURM_JWT\fR

.TP
\fBmax_token_lifespan\fR=<seconds>
Set max lifespan (in seconds) for any token generated for user accounts. Limit
applies to all users except SlurmUser. Sites wishing to have per user limits
should generate tokens using JWT\-compatible tools, and\/or an authenticating
proxy, instead of using \fIscontrol token\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBjwks\fR=
Absolute path to JWKS file. Key should be owned by SlurmUser or root, must be
readable by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of 0400. It must not be
writable by 'other'.
Only RS256 keys are supported, although other key types may be listed in the
file. If set, no HS256 key will be loaded by default (and token generation is
disabled), although the jwt_key setting may be used to explicitly re\-enable
HS256 key use (and token generation).
.IP

.TP
\fBjwt_key\fR=
Absolute path to JWT key file. Key must be HS256. Key should be owned by
SlurmUser or root, must be readable by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of

.RE
.IP

.TP
\fBAuthInfo\fR
Additional information to be used for authentication of communications
between the Slurm daemons (slurmctld and slurmd) and the Slurm
clients. The interpretation of this option is specific to the

Multiple options may be specified in a comma\-delimited list.
If not specified, the default authentication information will be used.
.IP
.RS
.TP 14
\fBcred_expire\fR
Default job step credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "cred_expire=1200").
It must be sufficiently long enough to load user environment, run prolog,
deal with the slurmd getting paged out of memory, etc.
This also controls how long a requeued job must wait before starting again.
The default value is 120 seconds.
.IP

.TP
\fBsocket\fR
Path name to a MUNGE daemon socket to use
(e.g. "socket=/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2").
The default value is "/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2".
Used by \fBauth/munge\fR and \fBcred/munge\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBttl\fR
Credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "ttl=300").
The default value is dependent on the \fBAuthType\fR used.
For \fBauth/munge\fR, the default value is dependent upon the MUNGE
installation, but is typically 300 seconds. For \fBauth/slurm\fR, the default
value is 60 seconds. For \fBauth/jwt\fR, the default value is 1800 seconds.
.IP

.TP
\fBuse_client_ids\fR
Allow the \fBauth/slurm\fR plugin to authenticate users without relying on
the user information from LDAP or the operating system. When coupled with
nss_slurm, the user information can be managed on the compute nodes by
slurmstepd. This would allow the cluster to operate in an environment where
only the login nodes have access to LDAP/OS user information.

.TP
\fBBatchStartTimeout\fR
The maximum time (in seconds) that a batch job is permitted for
launching before being considered missing and releasing the
allocation. The default value is 10 (seconds). Larger values may be
required if more time is required to execute the \fBProlog\fR, load
user environment variables, or if the slurmd daemon gets paged from memory.
.br
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: The test for a job being successfully launched is only performed when
the Slurm daemon on the compute node registers state with the slurmctld daemon
on the head node, which happens fairly rarely.
Therefore a job will not necessarily be terminated if its start time exceeds
\fBBatchStartTimeout\fR.
This configuration parameter is also applied to launch tasks and avoid aborting
\fBsrun\fR commands due to long running \fBProlog\fR scripts.

\fBBcastExclude\fR
Comma\-separated list of absolute directory paths to be excluded when
autodetecting and broadcasting executable shared object dependencies through
\fBsbcast\fR or \fBsrun \-\-bcast\fR. The keyword "\fInone\fR" can be used to
indicate that no directory paths should be excluded. The default value is

options available to salloc/sbatch/srun and \fIvalue\fR is a default value
defined by the user. For instance:

\fBCompleteWait\fR
The time to wait, in seconds, when any job is in the COMPLETING state
before any additional jobs are scheduled. This is to attempt to keep jobs on
nodes that were recently in use, with the goal of preventing fragmentation.
If set to zero, pending jobs will be started as soon as possible.
Since a COMPLETING job's resources are released for use by other
jobs as soon as the \fBEpilog\fR completes on each individual node,
this can result in very fragmented resource allocations.
To provide jobs with the minimum response time, a value of zero is
recommended (no waiting).
To minimize fragmentation of resources, a value equal to \fBKillWait\fR
plus two is recommended.
In that case, setting \fBKillWait\fR to a small value may be beneficial.
The default value of \fBCompleteWait\fR is zero seconds.
The value may not exceed 65533.

Default real memory size available per usable allocated CPU in megabytes.
Used to avoid over\-subscribing memory and causing paging.
\fBDefMemPerCPU\fR would generally be used if individual processors

The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see \fBDefMemPerGPU\fR, \fBDefMemPerNode\fR and \fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR.

\fBNOTE\fR: This applies to \fBusable\fR allocated CPUs in a job allocation.
This is important when more than one thread per core is configured.
If a job requests \-\-threads\-per\-core with fewer threads on a core than
exist on the core (or \-\-hint=nomultithread which implies
\-\-threads\-per\-core=1), the job will be unable to use those extra threads on
the core and those threads will not be included in the memory per CPU
calculation. But if the job has access to all threads on the core, those threads
will be included in the memory per CPU calculation even if the job did not
explicitly request those threads.

In the following examples, each core has two threads.

In this first example, two tasks can run on separate hyperthreads
in the same core because \-\-threads\-per\-core is not used. The
third task uses both threads of the second core. The allocated
memory per cpu includes all threads:

.nf
.ft B
$ salloc \-n3 \-\-mem\-per\-cpu=100
salloc: Granted job allocation 17199
$ sacct \-j $SLURM_JOB_ID \-X \-o jobid%7,reqtres%35,alloctres%35

  17199     billing=3,cpu=3,mem=300M,node=1     billing=4,cpu=4,mem=400M,node=1
.ft
.fi

In this second example, because of \-\-threads\-per\-core=1, each
task is allocated an entire core but is only able to use one
thread per core. Allocated CPUs includes all threads on each
core. However, allocated memory per cpu includes only the
usable thread in each core.

Fully qualified pathname of a script to execute as user root periodically
on all compute nodes that are \fBnot\fR in the NOT_RESPONDING state. This
program may be used to verify the node is fully operational and DRAIN the node
or send email if a problem is detected.
Any action to be taken must be explicitly performed by the program
(e.g. execute
"scontrol update NodeName=foo State=drain Reason=tmp_file_system_full"
to drain a node).
The execution interval is controlled using the \fBHealthCheckInterval\fR
parameter.
Note that the \fBHealthCheckProgram\fR will be executed at the same time
on all nodes to minimize its impact upon parallel programs.
This program will be killed if it does not terminate normally within
60 seconds.
This program will also be executed when the slurmd daemon is first started and
before it registers with the slurmctld daemon.
By default, no program will be executed.
.IP

.TP
\fBInactiveLimit\fR
The interval, in seconds, after which a non\-responsive job allocation
command (e.g. \fBsrun\fR or \fBsalloc\fR) will result in the job being
terminated. If the node on which the command is executed fails or the
command abnormally terminates, this will terminate its job allocation.
This option has no effect upon batch jobs.
When setting a value, take into consideration that a debugger using \fBsrun\fR
to launch an application may leave the \fBsrun\fR command in a stopped state
for extended periods of time.
This limit is ignored for jobs running in partitions with the
\fBRootOnly\fR flag set (the scheduler running as root will be
responsible for the job).
The default value is unlimited (zero) and may not exceed 65533 seconds.
.IP

.TP
\fBInteractiveStepOptions\fR
When LaunchParameters=use_interactive_step is enabled, launching salloc will
automatically start an srun process with InteractiveStepOptions to launch
a terminal on a node in the job allocation.
The default value is "\-\-interactive \-\-preserve\-env \-\-pty $SHELL".
The "\-\-interactive" option is intentionally not documented in the srun man
page. It is meant only to be used in \fBInteractiveStepOptions\fR in order to
create an "interactive step" that will not consume resources so that other
steps may run in parallel with the interactive step.

.TP
\fBJobAcctGatherType\fR
The JobAcctGather plugin collects memory, cpu, io, interconnect, energy and gpu
usage information at the task level, depending on which plugins are configured
in Slurm. This parameter will control how some of these metrics will be
collected. Unset by default.

Configurable values at present are:
.IP
.RS
.TP 20
\fBjobacct_gather/cgroup\fR (recommended)
Collect cpu and memory statistics by reading the task's cgroup directory
interfaces (e.g. memory.stat, cpu.stat) by issuing a call to the configured
CgroupPlugin (see "man cgroup.conf").
This mechanism ignores JobAcctGatherParams=UsePSS or NoShared since these are
used only when reading memory usage from the proc filesystem.
.IP

.TP
\fBjobacct_gather/linux\fR
Collect cpu and memory statistics by reading procfs. The plugin will take all
the pids of the task and for each of them will read /proc/<pid>/stats. If UsePSS
is set it will also read /proc/<pid>/smaps, and if NoShare is set it will also
read /proc/<pid>/statm (see \fBJobAcctGatherParams\fR for more information).

This plugin carries a performance penalty on jobs with a large number of spawned
processes since it needs to iterate over all the task pids and aggregate the
stats into one single metric for the ppid, and then these values need to be
aggregated to the task stats.

\fBJobAcctGatherFrequency\fR
The job accounting and profiling sampling intervals, specified for each data

\fBtask\fR=<\fIinterval\fR>
sampling interval in seconds for task usage by the jobacct_gather plugins and
for task profiling by the acct_gather_profile plugin.
Defaults to 30.
.br
.br
If this interval is 0 (disabled), accounting information is collected only at
job termination, which reduces Slurm
interference with the job, but also means that the statistics about a job
are only derived from a single sample and don't reflect the average or maximum
of several samples throughout the life of the job.

\fBUsePss\fR
Use PSS value instead of RSS to calculate real usage of memory. The PSS value
will be saved as RSS. This option cannot be used with NoShared. Only compatible
with \fBjobacct_gather/linux\fR plugin.
.IP

.TP
\fBOverMemoryKill\fR
Kill processes that are being detected to use more memory than requested by
steps every time accounting information is gathered by the JobAcctGather plugin.
This parameter should be used with caution because a job exceeding its memory
allocation may affect other processes and/or machine health.

\fBNOTE\fR: If available, it is recommended to limit memory by enabling
task/cgroup as a TaskPlugin and making use of ConstrainRAMSpace=yes in the
cgroup.conf instead of using this JobAcctGather mechanism for memory
enforcement. Using JobAcctGather is polling based and there is a
delay before a job is killed, which could lead to system Out of Memory events.

\fBNOTE\fR: When using \fBOverMemoryKill\fR, if the combined memory used by
all the processes in a step exceeds the memory limit, the entire step will be
killed/cancelled by the JobAcctGather plugin.
This differs from the behavior when using \fBConstrainRAMSpace\fR, where
processes in the step will be killed, but the step will be left active,
possibly with other processes left running.

When communication to the SlurmDBD is not possible the slurmctld will queue
messages meant to processed when the SlurmDBD is available again.
In order to avoid running out of memory the slurmctld will only queue so many
messages. The default value is 10000, or \fBMaxJobCount\fR * 2 + Node Count
* 4, whichever is greater. The value can not be less than 10000.
.IP

.TP
\fBMaxJobCount\fR
The maximum number of jobs slurmctld can have in memory at one time.
Combine with \fBMinJobAge\fR to ensure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust
its memory or other resources. Once this limit is reached, requests to submit
additional jobs will fail. The default value is 10000 jobs.
\fBNOTE\fR: Each task of a job array counts as one job even though they will not
occupy separate job records until modified or initiated.
Performance can suffer with more than a few hundred thousand jobs.
Setting per MaxSubmitJobs per user is generally valuable to prevent a single
user from filling the system with jobs.
This is accomplished using Slurm's database and configuring enforcement of
resource limits.
.IP

.TP
\fBMaxJobId\fR
The maximum job id to be used for jobs submitted to Slurm without a specific
requested value. Job ids are unsigned 32bit integers with the first 26 bits
reserved for local job ids and the remaining 6 bits reserved for a cluster id
to identify a federated job's origin. The maximum allowed local job id is
67,108,863 (0x3FFFFFF). The default value is 67,043,328 (0x03ff0000).
\fBMaxJobId\fR only applies to the local job id and not the federated job id.
Job id values generated will be incremented by 1 for each subsequent job. Once
\fBMaxJobId\fR is reached, the next job will be assigned \fBFirstJobId\fR.
Federated jobs will always have a job ID of 67,108,865 or higher.
Also see \fBFirstJobId\fR.

.TP
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR
Maximum real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.
Used to avoid over\-subscribing memory and causing paging.
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs (\fBSelectType=select/cons_tres\fR).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see \fBDefMemPerCPU\fR, \fBDefMemPerGPU\fR and \fBMaxMemPerNode\fR.
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR and \fBMaxMemPerNode\fR are mutually exclusive.

\fBNOTE\fR: If a job specifies a memory per CPU limit that exceeds this system
limit, that job's count of CPUs per task will try to automatically increase.
This may result in the job failing due to CPU count limits. This
auto\-adjustment feature is a best\-effort one and optimal assignment is not
guaranteed due to the possibility of having heterogeneous configurations and
multi\-partition/qos jobs. If this is a concern it is advised to use a job
submit LUA plugin instead to enforce auto\-adjustments to your specific needs.
.IP

.TP
\fBMaxMemPerNode\fR
Maximum real memory size available per allocated node in a job allocation in
megabytes. Used to avoid over\-subscribing memory and causing paging.
\fBMaxMemPerNode\fR would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs (\fBSelectType=select/linear\fR) and
resources are over\-subscribed (\fBOverSubscribe=yes\fR or
\fBOverSubscribe=force\fR).

\fBMinJobAge\fR
The minimum age of a completed job before its record is cleared from the list
of jobs slurmctld keeps in memory. Combine with \fBMaxJobCount\fR
to ensure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust
its memory or other resources. The default value is 300 seconds.
A value of zero prevents any job record purging.
Jobs are not purged during a backfill cycle, so it can take longer than
MinJobAge seconds to purge a job if using the backfill scheduling plugin.
In order to eliminate some possible race conditions, the minimum non\-zero

\fBOverTimeLimit\fR
Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before
being canceled.
Normally a job's time limit is treated as a \fIhard\fR limit and the job will be
killed upon reaching that limit.
Configuring \fBOverTimeLimit\fR will result in the job's time limit being
treated like a \fIsoft\fR limit.
Adding the \fBOverTimeLimit\fR value to the \fIsoft\fR time limit provides a
\fIhard\fR time limit, at which point the job is canceled.
This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon
each job's soft time limit.
The default value is zero.
May not exceed 65533 minutes.
A value of "UNLIMITED" is also supported.
.IP

.TP
\fBPluginDir\fR

.IP

.TP
\fBPlugStackConfig\fR
Location of the config file for Slurm stackable plugins that use
the Stackable Plugin Architecture for Node job (K)control (SPANK).
This provides support for a highly configurable set of plugins to
be called before and/or after execution of each task spawned as
part of a user's job step. Default location is "plugstack.conf"
in the same directory as the system slurm.conf. For more information
on SPANK plugins, see the \fBspank\fR(8) manual.
.IP

.TP
\fBPreemptMode\fR
Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling. When the
\fBPreemptType\fR parameter is set to enable preemption, the
\fBPreemptMode\fR selects the default mechanism used to preempt the eligible
jobs for the cluster.
.br
\fBPreemptMode\fR may be specified on a per partition basis to override this
default value if \fBPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR. Alternatively, it
can be specified on a per QOS basis if \fBPreemptType=preempt/qos\fR. In either
case, a valid default \fBPreemptMode\fR value must be specified for the
cluster as a whole when preemption is enabled.
.br
The \fBGANG\fR option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of
whether preemption is enabled (i.e. independent of the \fBPreemptType\fR
setting). It can be specified in addition to a \fBPreemptMode\fR setting with
the two options comma separated (e.g. \fBPreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG\fR).
.br
See <https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html> and
<https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html> for more details.

\fBNOTE\fR:
For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs,
not partial nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more
other jobs, the whole nodes for those preempted jobs are reserved for the
preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer resources than that.
These reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may
preempt more resources during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR:
For heterogeneous job to be considered for preemption all components
must be eligible for preemption. When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted
the first identified component of the job with the highest order PreemptMode
(\fBSUSPEND\fR (highest), \fBREQUEUE\fR, \fBCANCEL\fR (lowest)) will be
used to set the PreemptMode for all components. The \fBGraceTime\fR and user
warning signal for each component of the heterogeneous job remain unique.
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
.IP
.RS
.TP 12
\fBOFF\fR
Is the default value and disables job preemption and gang scheduling.
It is only compatible with preemption being disabled at the global level.
A common use case for this parameter is to set it on a partition to disable
preemption for that partition.
.IP

.TP
\fBCANCEL\fR
The preempted job will be cancelled.
.IP

.TP
\fBGANG\fR
Enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and
allows the resuming of suspended jobs. In order to use gang scheduling, the
\fBGANG\fR option must be specified at the cluster level.

\fBNOTE:\fR
If \fBGANG\fR scheduling is enabled with
\fBPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR, the controller will ignore
\fBPreemptExemptTime\fR and the following \fBPreemptParameters\fR:
\fBreorder_count\fR, \fBstrict_order\fR, and \fByoungest_first\fR.

\fBNOTE\fR:
Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so
if you only want time\-slicing by \fBOverSubscribe\fR, without any preemption,
then configuring partitions with overlapping nodes is not recommended.
On the other hand, if you want to use \fBPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR
to allow jobs from higher PriorityTier partitions to Suspend jobs from lower
PriorityTier partitions you will need overlapping partitions, and
\fBPreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG\fR to use the Gang scheduler to resume the suspended
jobs(s). You must configure the partition's \fIOverSubscribe\fR setting to
\fIFORCE\fR for all partitions in which time\-slicing is to take place.
In any case, time\-slicing won't happen between jobs on different partitions.

\fBNOTE\fR:
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.

\fBNOTE\fR:
In case of overlapping partitions. If the node is allocated job that allows
sharing of resources (Oversubscribe=FORCE or Oversubscribe=YES and job was
submitted with \fB\-s\fR/\fB\-\-oversubscribe\fR) it can only be allocated by
jobs from the same partition.

.IP

.TP
\fBREQUEUE\fR
Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or canceling them.
For jobs to be requeued they must have the \-\-requeue sbatch option set
or the cluster wide JobRequeue parameter in slurm.conf must be set to \fB1\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBSUSPEND\fR
The preempted jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume
them. Therefore the \fBSUSPEND\fR preemption mode always needs the \fBGANG\fR
option to be specified at the cluster level. Also, because the suspended jobs
will still use memory on the allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to track
memory resources to be able to suspend jobs.
.br
When suspending jobs, Slurm sends the SIGTSTP signal, waits the time specified
by \fBPreemptParameters=suspend_grace_time\fR (default is 2 seconds), then
sends the SIGSTOP signal. The SIGCONT signal is sent when resuming jobs.
.br
If \fBPreemptType=preempt/qos\fR is configured and if the preempted job(s) and
the preemptor job are on the same partition, then they will share resources with
the Gang scheduler (time\-slicing). If not (i.e. if the preemptees and preemptor
are on different partitions) then the preempted jobs will remain suspended until
the preemptor ends.

\fBNOTE\fR: Because gang scheduling is performed independently for each
partition, if using \fBPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR then jobs in
higher PriorityTier partitions will suspend jobs in lower PriorityTier
partitions to run on the released resources. Only when the preemptor job ends
will the suspended jobs will be resumed by the Gang scheduler.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: Suspended jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not
be able to preempt to gain access to GRES.
.IP

\fBstrict_order\fR
When reordering preemptable jobs, place the most recently tested job at the
front of the list since we are certain that it actually added resources needed

\fBProlog\fR
Pathname of a program for the slurmd to execute whenever it is asked to run a
job step from a new job allocation. If it is not an absolute path name (i.e. it
does not start with a slash), it will be searched for in the same directory as
the slurm.conf file. A glob pattern (See \fBglob\fR (7)) may also be used to
specify more than one program to run (e.g. "/etc/slurm/prolog.d/*"). When more
than one prolog script is configured, they are executed in reverse alphabetical
order (z-a -> Z-A -> 9-0). The slurmd executes the prolog before starting
the first job step. The prolog script or scripts may be used to purge files,
enable user login, etc. By default there is no prolog. Any configured script
is expected to complete execution quickly (in less time than
\fBMessageTimeout\fR).
If the prolog fails (returns a non\-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state and the job being requeued. The job will be
placed in a held state, unless \fBnohold_on_prolog_fail\fR is configured in
\fBSchedulerParameters\fR.

Currently supported options are:
.IP
.RS
.TP 8
\fBAlloc\fR
If set, the Prolog script will be executed at job allocation. By default,
Prolog is executed just before the task is launched. Therefore, when salloc
is started, no Prolog is executed. Alloc is useful for preparing things
before a user starts to use any allocated resources.
In particular, this flag is needed on a Cray system when cluster compatibility
mode is enabled.

\fBNOTE\fR: Use of the Alloc flag will increase the time required to start jobs.
.IP

.TP
\fBContain\fR
At job allocation time, use the ProcTrack plugin to create a job container
on all allocated compute nodes.
This container may be used for user processes not launched under Slurm control,
for example pam_slurm_adopt may place processes launched through a direct user
login into this container. If using pam_slurm_adopt, then ProcTrackType must be
set to \fBproctrack/cgroup\fR.
Setting the Contain implicitly sets the Alloc flag.
.IP

.TP
\fBDeferBatch\fR
If set, slurmctld will wait until the prolog completes on all allocated
nodes before sending the batch job launch request. With just the Alloc flag,
slurmctld will launch the batch step as soon as the first node in the job
allocation completes the prolog.
.IP

.TP
\fBNoHold\fR
If set, the Alloc flag should also be set. This will allow for salloc to not
block until the prolog is finished on each node. The blocking will happen when
steps reach the slurmd and before any execution has happened in the step.
This is a much faster way to work and if using srun to launch your tasks you
should use this flag. This flag cannot be combined with the Contain or X11
flags.
.IP

.TP
\fBForceRequeueOnFail\fR
When a batch job fails to launch due to a Prolog failure, always requeue it

.TP
\fBRunInJob\fR
Make the Prolog/Epilog run in the extern slurmstepd. This will contain it in one

\fBPrologSlurmctld\fR
Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld daemon to execute
before granting a new job allocation (e.g.
"/usr/local/slurm/prolog_controller").
The program executes as SlurmUser on the same node where the slurmctld daemon
executes, giving it permission to drain
nodes and requeue the job if a failure occurs or cancel the job if appropriate.
Exactly what the program does and how it accomplishes this is completely at
the discretion of the system administrator.
Information about the job being initiated, its allocated nodes, etc. are
passed to the program using environment variables.
While this program is running, the nodes associated with the job will be
have a POWER_UP/CONFIGURING flag set in their state, which can be readily
viewed.
The slurmctld daemon will wait indefinitely for this program to complete.
Once the program completes with an exit code of zero, the nodes will be
considered ready for use and the program will be started.
If some node can not be made available for use, the program should drain
the node (typically using the scontrol command) and terminate with a non\-zero
exit code.
A non\-zero exit code will result in the job being requeued (where possible)
or killed. Note that only batch jobs can be requeued.

\fBPropagateResourceLimits\fR
A comma\-separated list of resource limit names.
The slurmd daemon uses these names to obtain the associated (soft) limit
values from the user's process environment on the submit node.
These limits are then propagated and applied to the jobs that
will run on the compute nodes.
This parameter can be useful when system limits vary among nodes.
Any resource limits that do not appear in the list are not propagated.
However, the user can override this by specifying which resource limits
to propagate with the sbatch or srun "\-\-propagate" option. If neither
\fBPropagateResourceLimits\fR or \fBPropagateResourceLimitsExcept\fR are
configured and the "\-\-propagate" option is not specified, then the default
action is to propagate all limits. Only one of the parameters, either
PropagateResourceLimits or PropagateResourceLimitsExcept, may be specified.
The user limits can not exceed hard limits under which the slurmd daemon
operates. If the user limits are not propagated, the limits from the slurmd
daemon will be propagated to the user's job. The limits used for the Slurm
daemons can be set in the /etc/sysconf/slurm file. For more information, see:

.IP

.TP
\fBResumeProgram\fR
Slurm supports a mechanism to reduce power consumption on nodes that
remain idle for an extended period of time.
This is typically accomplished by reducing voltage and frequency or powering
the node down.
\fBResumeProgram\fR is the program that will be executed when a node
in power save mode is assigned work to perform.
For reasons of reliability, \fBResumeProgram\fR may execute more than once
for a node when the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon crashes and is restarted.
If \fBResumeProgram\fR is unable to restore a node to service with a responding
slurmd and an updated BootTime, it should set the node state to DOWN, which will
result in a requeue of any job associated with the node - this will happen
automatically if the node doesn't register within ResumeTimeout.
\fBSchedulerParameters=requeue_on_resume_failure\fR can be used to always
requeue batch jobs in this situation, even if the job requested no requeues.
If the node isn't actually rebooted (i.e. when multiple\-slurmd is configured)
starting slurmd with "\-b" option might be useful.
The program executes as \fBSlurmUser\fR.
The argument to the program will be the names of nodes to
be removed from power savings mode (using Slurm's hostlist
expression format). A job to node mapping is available in JSON format by
reading the temporary file specified by the \fBSLURM_RESUME_FILE\fR environment
variable.
This file is closed once slurmctld shuts down. If ResumeProgram is running,
slurmctld shutdown is delayed by up to ten seconds to give ResumeProgram time
to read this file. Therefore, this file should be read at the beginning of
ResumeProgram.
By default no program is run.
Programs will be killed if they run longer than the largest configured, global
or partition, \fBResumeTimeout\fR or \fBSuspendTimeout\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBResumeRate\fR
The rate at which nodes in power save mode are returned to normal
operation by \fBResumeProgram\fR.
The value is a number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent
power surges if a large number of nodes in power save mode are
assigned work at the same time (e.g. a large job starts).
A value of zero results in no limits being imposed.
The default value is 300 nodes per minute.
.IP

.TP
\fBResumeTimeout\fR
Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node resume request
is issued and when the node is actually available for use.
Nodes which fail to respond in this time frame will be marked DOWN and

By default the backfill scheduler will not add a slot in the bf plan when a job

\fBbf_hetjob_immediate\fR
Instruct the backfill scheduler to attempt to start a heterogeneous job as
soon as all of its components are determined able to do so. Otherwise, the
backfill scheduler will delay heterogeneous jobs initiation attempts until
after the rest of the queue has been processed. This delay may result in lower
priority jobs being allocated resources, which could delay the initiation of
the heterogeneous job due to account and/or QOS limits being reached. This
option is disabled by default. If enabled and \fBbf_hetjob_prio=min\fR is not
set, then it would be automatically set.
.IP

.TP
\fBbf_hetjob_prio=[min|avg|max]\fR
At the beginning of each backfill scheduling cycle, a list of pending to be
scheduled jobs is sorted according to the precedence order configured in
\fBPriorityType\fR. This option instructs the scheduler to alter the sorting
algorithm to ensure that all components belonging to the same heterogeneous job
will be attempted to be scheduled consecutively (thus not fragmented in the
resulting list). More specifically, all components from the same heterogeneous
job will be treated as if they all have the same priority (minimum, average or
maximum depending upon this option's parameter) when compared with other jobs
(or other heterogeneous job components). The original order will be preserved
within the same heterogeneous job. Note that the operation is calculated for
the \fBPriorityTier\fR layer and for the \fBPriority\fR resulting from the
priority/multifactor plugin calculations. When enabled, if any heterogeneous job
requested an advanced reservation, then all of that job's components will be
treated as if they had requested an advanced reservation (and get
preferential treatment in scheduling).

Note that this operation does not update the \fBPriority\fR values of the
heterogeneous job components, only their order within the list, so the output of
the sprio command will not be affected.

Heterogeneous jobs have special scheduling properties: they are only scheduled
by the backfill scheduling plugin, each of their components is considered
separately when reserving resources (and might have different \fBPriorityTier\fR
or different \fBPriority\fR values), and no heterogeneous job component is
actually allocated resources until all if its components can be initiated.
This may imply potential scheduling deadlock scenarios because components
from different heterogeneous jobs can start reserving resources in an
interleaved fashion (not consecutively), but none of the jobs can reserve
resources for all components and start. Enabling this option can help to
mitigate this problem. By default, this option is disabled.

The default value is the value of bf_interval (which defaults to 30 seconds).
Default: bf_interval value (def. 30 sec), Min: 1, Max: 3600 (1h).
\fBNOTE\fR: If bf_interval is short and bf_max_time is large, this may cause
locks to be acquired too frequently and starve out other serviced RPCs. It's
advisable if using this parameter to set max_rpc_cnt high enough that
scheduling isn't always disabled, and low enough that the interactive
workload can get through in a reasonable period of time. max_rpc_cnt needs to
be below 256 (the default RPC thread limit). Running around the middle (150)
may give you good results.
\fBNOTE\fR: When increasing the amount of time spent in the backfill scheduling

manner. To address this you can use \fBmax_rpc_cnt\fR to specify a number of
queued RPCs before the scheduler stops to respond to these requests.

.TP
\fBbf_one_resv_per_job\fR
Disallow adding more than one backfill reservation per job.
The scheduling logic builds a sorted list of job-partition pairs. Jobs
submitted to multiple partitions have as many entries in the list as requested
partitions. By default, the backfill scheduler may evaluate all the
job-partition entries for a single job, potentially reserving resources for
each pair, but only starting the job in the reservation offering the earliest
start time.
Having a single job reserving resources for multiple partitions could impede
other jobs (or hetjob components) from reserving resources already reserved for
the partitions that don't offer the earliest start time.
A single job that requests multiple partitions can also prevent itself from
starting earlier in a lower priority partition if the partitions overlap
nodes and a backfill reservation in the higher priority partition blocks nodes
that are also in the lower priority partition.
This option makes it so that a job submitted to multiple partitions will stop
reserving resources once the first job-partition pair has booked a backfill
reservation. Subsequent pairs from the same job will only be tested to start
now. This allows for other jobs to be able to book the other pairs resources at
the cost of not guaranteeing that the multi partition job will start in the
partition offering the earliest start time (unless it can start immediately).
This option is disabled by default.

\fBbf_window_linear\fR=\#
For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler will decrease precision in
calculation of job expected termination times. By default, the precision starts
at 30 seconds and that time interval doubles with each evaluation of currently
executing jobs when trying to determine when a pending job can start. This
algorithm can support an environment with many thousands of running jobs, but
can result in the expected start time of pending jobs being gradually being
deferred due to lack of precision. A value for bf_window_linear will cause
the time interval to be increased by a constant amount on each iteration.
The value is specified in units of seconds. For example, a value of 60 will
cause the backfill scheduler on the first iteration to identify the job ending
soonest and determine if the pending job can be started after that job plus
all other jobs expected to end within 30 seconds (default initial value) of the
first job. On the next iteration, the pending job will be evaluated for
starting after the next job expected to end plus all jobs ending within
90 seconds of that time (30 second default, plus the 60 second option value).
The third iteration will have a 150 second window and the fourth 210 seconds.
Without this option, the time windows will double on each iteration and thus
be 30, 60, 120, 240 seconds, etc. The use of bf_window_linear is not recommended
with more than a few hundred simultaneously executing jobs.

new jobs, which is the opposite of \fBmax_rpc_cnt\fR. In conjunction with

the job's node and CPU specification if TopologyPlugin=topology/flat is
configured. Use of other topology plugins with select/linear and heterogeneous
nodes is not recommended and may result in valid job allocation requests being
rejected. The linear plugin is not designed to track generic resources on a
node. In cases where generic resources (such as GPUs) need to be tracked,
the cons_tres plugin should be used instead.

\fBSelectTypeParameters\fR
The permitted values of \fBSelectTypeParameters\fR depend upon the
configured value of \fBSelectType\fR.
The only supported options for \fBSelectType=select/linear\fR are
\fBCR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE\fR and
\fBCR_Memory\fR, which treats memory as a consumable resource and
prevents memory over subscription with job preemption or gang scheduling.
By default \fBSelectType=select/linear\fR allocates whole nodes to jobs without
considering their memory consumption.
By default \fBSelectType=select/cons_tres\fR uses \fBCR_Core_Memory\fR, which
allocates Core to jobs while considering their memory consumption.

The following options are supported by the \fBSelectType=select/cons_tres\fR

resource allocation.
The node's \fBBoards\fR, \fBSockets\fR, \fBCoresPerSocket\fR and
\fBThreadsPerCore\fR may optionally be configured and result in job

\fBCR_Core\fR
Cores are consumable resources.
On nodes with hyper\-threads, each thread is counted as a CPU to
satisfy a job's resource requirement, but multiple jobs are not
allocated threads on the same core.
The count of CPUs allocated to a job is rounded up to account for every
CPU on an allocated core. This will also impact total allocated memory when
-\-mem\-per\-cpu is used to be multiply of total number of CPUs on allocated cores.

\fBNOTE\fR: This option cannot be used with CR_CPU*.
.IP

.TP
\fBCR_CORE_DEFAULT_DIST_BLOCK\fR
Allocate cores within a node using block distribution by default.
This is a pseudo\-best\-fit algorithm that minimizes the number of
boards and minimizes the number of sockets (within minimum boards)
used for the allocation.
This default behavior can be overridden specifying a particular
"\-m" parameter with srun/salloc/sbatch.
Without this option, cores will be allocated cyclically across the sockets.
.IP

.TP
\fBCR_LLN\fR
Schedule resources to jobs on the least loaded nodes (based upon the number
of idle CPUs). This is generally only recommended for an environment with
serial jobs as idle resources will tend to be highly fragmented, resulting
in parallel jobs being distributed across many nodes.
Note that node \fBWeight\fR takes precedence over how many idle resources are
on each node.
Also see the partition configuration parameter \fBLLN\fR
use the least loaded nodes in selected partitions.
.IP

.TP
\fBCR_Pack_Nodes\fR
If a job allocation contains more resources than will be used for launching
tasks (e.g. if whole nodes are allocated to a job), then rather than
distributing a job's tasks evenly across its allocated nodes, pack them as
tightly as possible on these nodes.
For example, consider a job allocation containing two \fBentire\fR nodes with
eight CPUs each.
If the job starts ten tasks across those two nodes without this option, it will
start five tasks on each of the two nodes.
With this option, eight tasks will be started on the first node and two tasks
on the second node.
This can be superseded by "NoPack" in srun's "\-\-distribution" option.
CR_Pack_Nodes only applies when the "block" task distribution method is used.
.IP

\fBLL_SHARED_GRES\fR
When allocating resources for a shared GRES (gres/mps, gres/shard), prefer
least loaded device (in terms of already allocated fraction). This way jobs are

the first available device is used.
This option is only supported by select/cons_tres plugin.
.IP

\fBCR_Socket\fR
Sockets are consumable resources.
On nodes with multiple cores, each core or thread is counted as a CPU

\fBMULTIPLE_SHARING_GRES_PJ\fR
By default, only one sharing gres per job is allowed on each node from shared
gres requests. This allows multiple sharing gres' to be used on a single node
to satisfy shared gres requirements per job.
Example: If there are 10 shards to a gpu and 12 shards are requested, instead of
being denied the job will be allocated with 2 gpus. 1 using 10 shards and the
other using 2 shards.

\fBSlurmctldHost\fR
The short, or long, hostname of the machine where Slurm control daemon is
executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname \-s").
This hostname is optionally followed by either the IP address or
a name by which the address can be identified, enclosed in parentheses. e.g.
.nf
SlurmctldHost=slurmctl\-primary(12.34.56.78)
.fi

Each host running an instance of slurmctld should have a \fBSlurmctldHost=\fR
entry.  e.g.
.nf
SlurmctldHost=slurmctl\-primary1
SlurmctldHost=slurmctl\-primary2
SlurmctldHost=slurmctl\-primary3(12.34.56.78)
.fi

SlurmctldHost must be specified at least once. If specified more than once, the
first entry will run as the primary and all other entries as standby backups.
If the primary host fails, the first backup will change from standby to primary
until the first host comes back online. This same process will repeat if the new
primary fails.

Slurm daemons need to be reconfigured (e.g. "scontrol reconfig") for changes to
this parameter to take effect. It is okay for jobs to be running when making
these changes, as the running steps will get the updated SlurmctldHost info.

Every slurmctld host controller must have access to the \fBStateSaveLocation\fR
directory, which must be readable and writable from the primary and all backup
controllers at all times.

Refer to the \fBRELOCATING CONTROLLERS\fR section if you need to change this.

By default, Slurm expects that the network address for a cloud node won't
be known until the creation of the node and that Slurm will be notified of the
node's address (e.g. \fBscontrol update nodename=<name> nodeaddr=<addr>\fR).
Since Slurm communications rely on the node configuration found in the
slurm.conf, Slurm will tell the client command, after waiting for all nodes to
boot, each node's ip address. However, in environments where the nodes are in
DNS, this step can be avoided by configuring this option.

\fBSlurmdTimeout\fR
The interval, in seconds, that the Slurm controller waits for \fBslurmd\fR
to respond before configuring that node's state to DOWN.
A value of zero indicates the node will not be tested by \fBslurmctld\fR to
confirm the state of \fBslurmd\fR, the node will not be automatically set to
a DOWN state indicating a non\-responsive \fBslurmd\fR, and some other tool
will take responsibility for monitoring the state of each compute node
and its \fBslurmd\fR daemon.
Slurm's hierarchical communication mechanism is used to ping the \fBslurmd\fR

\fBSrunEpilog\fR
Fully qualified pathname of an executable to be run by srun following
the completion of a job step. The command line arguments for the
executable will be the command and arguments of the job step. This
configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's \fB\-\-epilog\fR
parameter. Note that while the other "Epilog" executables (e.g.,
TaskEpilog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the tasks are
executed, the \fBSrunEpilog\fR runs on the node where the "srun" is
executing.
.IP

.TP
\fBSrunPortRange\fR
The \fBsrun\fR creates a set of listening ports to communicate with the
controller, the slurmstepd and to handle the application I/O.
By default these ports are ephemeral meaning the port numbers are selected
by the kernel. Using this parameter allow sites to configure a range of ports
from which srun ports will be selected. This is useful if sites want to
allow only certain port range on their network.

\fBNOTE\fR: On Cray systems, Realm\-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will
automatically try to interact with anything opened on ports 8192\-60000.
Configure SrunPortRange to use a range of ports above those used by RSIP,
ideally 1000 or more ports, for example "SrunPortRange=60001\-63000".

\fBNOTE\fR: \fBSrunPortRange\fR must be large enough to cover the expected
number of srun ports created. A single srun opens 4 listening ports plus 2
more for every 48 hosts beyond the first 48. Use of the \fB\-\-pty\fR option
will result in an additional port being used.

Example:
.nf
srun \-N 1        will use 4 listening ports.
srun \-\-pty \-N 1  will use 5 listening ports.
srun \-N 48       will use 4 listening ports.
srun \-N 50       will use 6 listening ports.
srun \-N 200      will use 12 listening ports.

configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's \fB\-\-prolog\fR
parameter. Note that while the other "Prolog" executables (e.g.,
TaskProlog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the tasks are
executed, the \fBSrunProlog\fR runs on the node where the "srun" is
executing.

\fBSlurmUser\fR must be able to create files in this directory.
If you have a secondary \fBSlurmctldHost\fR configured, this location should be
readable and writable by both systems.
Since all running and pending job information is stored here, the use of

\fBSuspendExcNodes\fR
Specifies the nodes which are to not be placed in power save mode, even
if the node remains idle for an extended period of time.
Use Slurm's hostlist expression or NodeSets to identify nodes with an optional
":" separator and count of nodes to exclude from the preceding range.
For example "nid[10\-20]:4" will prevent 4 powered up nodes in the set
"nid[10\-20]" from being powered down.
Multiple sets of nodes can be specified with or without counts in a comma
separated list (e.g "nid[10\-20]:4,nid[80\-90]:2").
By default no nodes are excluded.

This program is expected to place the node into some power save mode.
This can be used to reduce the frequency and voltage of a node or
completely power the node off.
The program executes as \fBSlurmUser\fR.
The argument to the program will be the names of nodes to
be placed into power savings mode (using Slurm's hostlist

\fBTreeWidth\fR
\fBSlurmd\fR daemons use a virtual tree network for communications.
\fBTreeWidth\fR specifies the width of the tree (i.e. the fanout).
The default value is 16, meaning each slurmd daemon can
communicate with up to 16 other slurmd daemons. This value balances offloading
slurmctld (max 16 threads running), time of communication, and node fault
tolerance (4368 nodes can be contacted with three message hops). The default
value will work well for most clusters however on bigger systems this value can
be increased to avoid long timeouts and retransmissions in case of unresponsive
nodes. The value may not exceed 65533.

\fBUnkillableStepProgram\fR
If the processes in a job step are determined to be unkillable for a period

.TP
\fBUnkillableStepTimeout\fR
The length of time, in seconds, that Slurm will wait before deciding that
processes in a job step are unkillable (after they have been signaled with
SIGKILL) and execute \fBUnkillableStepProgram\fR.
The default timeout value is 60 seconds or five times the value of
MessageTimeout, whichever is greater.
If exceeded, the compute node will be drained to prevent future jobs from being
scheduled on the node.

\fBNOTE\fR: Ensure that UnkillableStepTimeout is at least 5 times larger than
MessageTimeout, otherwise it can lead to unexpected draining of nodes.
.IP

.TP
\fBUsePAM\fR
If set to 1, PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) will be enabled.
PAM is used to establish the upper bounds for resource limits. With PAM support
enabled, local system administrators can dynamically configure system resource
limits. Changing the upper bound of a resource limit will not alter the limits
of running jobs, only jobs started after a change has been made will pick up
the new limits.
The default value is 0 (not to enable PAM support).
Remember that PAM also needs to be configured to support Slurm as a service.
For sites using PAM's directory based configuration option, a configuration
file named \fBslurm\fR should be created. The module\-type, control\-flags, and
module\-path names that should be included in the file are:
.br
auth        required      pam_localuser.so
.br
auth        required      pam_shells.so
.br
account     required      pam_unix.so
.br
account     required      pam_access.so
.br
session     required      pam_unix.so
.br
For sites configuring PAM with a general configuration file, the appropriate
lines (see above), where \fBslurm\fR is the service\-name, should be added.
See <https://slurm.schedmd.com/pam_slurm_adopt.html> for more details.

\fBNOTE\fR: UsePAM option has nothing to do with the
\fBcontribs/pam/pam_slurm\fR and/or \fBcontribs/pam_slurm_adopt\fR modules. So
these two modules can work independently of the value set for UsePAM.

.TP
\fBVSizeFactor\fR
Memory specifications in job requests apply to real memory size (also known
as resident set size). It is possible to enforce virtual memory limits for
both jobs and job steps by limiting their virtual memory to some percentage
of their real memory allocation. The \fBVSizeFactor\fR parameter specifies
the job's or job step's virtual memory limit as a percentage of its real
memory limit. For example, if a job's real memory limit is 500MB and
VSizeFactor is set to 101 then the job will be killed if its real memory
exceeds 500MB or its virtual memory exceeds 505MB (101 percent of the
real memory limit).
The default value is 0, which disables enforcement of virtual memory limits.
The value may not exceed 65533 percent.

\fBNOTE\fR: This parameter is dependent on \fBOverMemoryKill\fR being
configured in \fBJobAcctGatherParams\fR. It is also possible
to configure the \fBTaskPlugin\fR to use \fBtask/cgroup\fR for memory
enforcement. \fBVSizeFactor\fR will not have an effect on memory enforcement
done through cgroups.

.SH "NODE CONFIGURATION"
The configuration of nodes (or machines) to be managed by Slurm is
also specified in \fB/etc/slurm.conf\fR.
Changes in node configuration (e.g. adding nodes, changing their
processor count, etc.) require restarting or reconfiguring all slurmctld
and slurmd daemons.
All slurmd daemons must know each node in the system to forward
messages in support of hierarchical communications.
Only the NodeName must be supplied in the configuration file.
All other node configuration information is optional.
It is advisable to establish baseline node configurations,
especially if the cluster is heterogeneous.
Nodes which register to the system with less than the configured resources
(e.g. too little memory), will be placed in the "DOWN" state to
avoid scheduling jobs on them.
Establishing baseline configurations will also speed Slurm's
scheduling process by permitting it to compare job requirements
against these (relatively few) configuration parameters and
possibly avoid having to check job requirements
against every individual node's configuration.
The resources checked at node registration time are: CPUs,
RealMemory and TmpDisk.
.LP
Default values can be specified with a record in which
\fBNodeName\fR is "DEFAULT".
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "NodeName=DEFAULT".
Each line where \fBNodeName\fR is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous
default values and will not reinitialize the default values.
The "NodeName=" specification must be placed on every line
describing the configuration of nodes.
A single node name can not appear as a NodeName value in more than one line
(duplicate node name records will be ignored).
In fact, it is generally possible and desirable to define the
configurations of all nodes in only a few lines.
This convention permits significant optimization in the scheduling
of larger clusters.
In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes
on some architectures,
node specifications should be place in this file in consecutive order.
No single node name may be listed more than once in the configuration
file.
Use "DownNodes=" to record the state of nodes which are temporarily
in a DOWN, DRAIN or FAILING state without altering permanent
configuration information.
A job step's tasks are allocated to nodes in order the nodes appear
in the configuration file. There is presently no capability within
Slurm to arbitrarily order a job step's tasks.
.LP
Multiple node names may be comma separated (e.g. "alpha,beta,gamma")
and/or a simple node range expression may optionally be used to
specify numeric ranges of nodes to avoid building a configuration
file with large numbers of entries.
The node range expression can contain one pair of square brackets
with a sequence of comma\-separated numbers and/or ranges of numbers
separated by a "\-" (e.g. "linux[0\-64,128]", or "lx[15,18,32\-33]").
Note that the numeric ranges can include one or more leading
zeros to indicate the numeric portion has a fixed number of digits
(e.g. "linux[0000\-1023]").
Multiple numeric ranges can be included in the expression
(e.g. "rack[0\-63]_blade[0\-41]").
If one or more numeric expressions are included, one of them
must be at the end of the name (e.g. "unit[0\-31]rack" is invalid),
but arbitrary names can always be used in a comma\-separated list.
.LP
The node configuration specified the following information:

.TP
\fBNodeName\fR
Name that Slurm uses to refer to a node.
Typically this would be the string that "/bin/hostname \-s" returns.
It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "/bin/hostname \-f"
(e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain name associated with the host
through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver
settings. Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it
may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets
must be at the end of the string).
It may also be an arbitrary string if \fBNodeHostname\fR is specified.
If the \fBNodeName\fR is "DEFAULT", the values specified
with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications
unless explicitly set to other values in that node record or
replaced with a different set of default values.
Each line where \fBNodeName\fR is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous
default values and not reinitialize the default values.
For architectures in which the node order is significant,
nodes will be considered consecutive in the order defined.
For example, if the configuration for "NodeName=charlie" immediately
follows the configuration for "NodeName=baker" they will be
considered adjacent in the computer.
\fBNOTE\fR: If the \fBNodeName\fR is "ALL" the process parsing the configuration
will exit immediately as it is an internally reserved word.
.IP

.TP
\fBNodeHostname\fR
Typically this would be the string that "/bin/hostname \-s" returns.
It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "/bin/hostname \-f"
(e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain name associated with the host
through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver
settings. Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it
may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets
must be at the end of the string).
A node range expression can be used to specify a set of nodes.
If an expression is used, the number of nodes identified by
\fBNodeHostname\fR on a line in the configuration file must
be identical to the number of nodes identified by \fBNodeName\fR.
By default, the \fBNodeHostname\fR will be identical in value to
\fBNodeName\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBNodeAddr\fR
Name that a node should be referred to in establishing
a communications path.
This name will be used as an
argument to the getaddrinfo() function for identification.
If a node range expression is used to designate multiple nodes,
they must exactly match the entries in the \fBNodeName\fR
(e.g. "NodeName=lx[0\-7] NodeAddr=elx[0\-7]").
\fBNodeAddr\fR may also contain IP addresses.
By default, the \fBNodeAddr\fR will be identical in value to
\fBNodeHostname\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBBcastAddr\fR
Alternate network path to be used for sbcast network traffic to a given node.
This name will be used as an argument to the getaddrinfo() function.
If a node range expression is used to designate multiple nodes,
they must exactly match the entries in the \fBNodeName\fR
(e.g. "NodeName=lx[0\-7] BcastAddr=elx[0\-7]").
\fBBcastAddr\fR may also contain IP addresses.
By default, the \fBBcastAddr\fR is unset, and sbcast traffic will be routed
to the \fBNodeAddr\fR for a given node.
Note: cannot be used with CommunicationParameters=NoInAddrAny.
.IP

.TP
\fBBoards\fR
Number of Baseboards in nodes with a baseboard controller.
Note that when Boards is specified, SocketsPerBoard,
CoresPerSocket, and ThreadsPerCore should be specified.
The default value is 1.
.IP

.TP
\fBCoreSpecCount\fR
Number of cores reserved for system use.
Depending upon the \fBTaskPluginParam\fR option of \fBSlurmdOffSpec\fR,
the Slurm daemon slurmd may either be confined to these
resources (the default) or prevented from using these resources.
If cgroup/v1 is used, the same applies to the slurmstepd processes.
Isolation of slurmd from user jobs may improve application performance.
A job can use these cores if AllowSpecResourcesUsage=yes and the user
explicitly requests less than the configured CoreSpecCount.
If this option and \fBCpuSpecList\fR are both designated for a
node, an error is generated. For information on the algorithm used by Slurm
to select the cores refer to the core specialization documentation
( https://slurm.schedmd.com/core_spec.html ).
.IP

.TP
\fBCoresPerSocket\fR
Number of cores in a single physical processor socket (e.g. "2").
The CoresPerSocket value describes physical cores, not the
logical number of processors per socket.
\fBNOTE\fR: If you have multi\-core processors, you will likely
need to specify this parameter in order to optimize scheduling.
The default value is 1.
.IP

.TP
\fBCpuBind\fR
If a job step request does not specify an option to control how tasks are bound
to allocated CPUs (by using \-\-cpu\-bind) and all nodes allocated to the job
have the same \fBCpuBind\fR option, the node \fBCpuBind\fR option will control
how tasks are bound to allocated resources. Partition definitions are used next
if the node definition(s) can't be used, followed by \fBTaskPluginParam\fR as a
last resort, with the default being no binding. Supported values for
CpuBind are \fBnone\fR, \fBsocket\fR, \fBldom\fR (NUMA), \fBcore\fR and
\fBthread\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBCPUs\fR
Number of logical processors on the node (e.g. "2").
It can be set to the total
number of sockets(supported only by select/linear), cores or threads.
This can be useful when you want to schedule only the cores on a hyper\-threaded
node. If \fBCPUs\fR is omitted, its default will be set equal to the product of
\fBBoards\fR, \fBSockets\fR, \fBCoresPerSocket\fR, and \fBThreadsPerCore\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBCpuSpecList\fR
A comma\-delimited list of Slurm abstract CPU IDs reserved for system use.
The list will be expanded to include all other CPUs, if any, on the same cores.
Depending upon the \fBTaskPluginParam\fR option of \fBSlurmdOffSpec\fR,
the Slurm daemon slurmd may either be confined to these
resources (the default) or prevented from using these resources.
If cgroup/v1 is used, the same applies to the slurmstepd processes.
Isolation of slurmd from user jobs may improve application performance.
A job can use these cores if AllowSpecResourcesUsage=yes and the user
explicitly requests less than the number of CPUs in this list.
If this option and \fBCoreSpecCount\fR are both designated for a node,
an error is generated.
This option has no effect unless cgroup job confinement is also configured
(i.e. the \fItask/cgroup\fR \fBTaskPlugin\fR is enabled and
\fBConstrainCores=yes\fR is set in cgroup.conf).
.IP

.TP
\fBFeatures\fR
A comma\-delimited list of arbitrary strings indicative of some
characteristic associated with the node.
There is no value or count associated with a feature at this time, a node
either has a feature or it does not.
A desired feature may contain a numeric component indicating,
for example, processor speed but this numeric component will be considered to
be part of the feature string. Features are intended to be used to filter nodes
eligible to run jobs via the \fB\-\-constraint\fR argument.
By default a node has no features.
Also see \fBGres\fR for being able to have more control such as types and
count. Using features is faster than scheduling against GRES but is limited to
Boolean operations.

\fBNOTE\fR: The hostlist function \fBfeature{myfeature}\fR expands to all nodes
with the specified feature. This may be used in place of or alongside regular
hostlist expressions in commands or configuration files that interact with the
slurmctld.
For example: \fBscontrol update node=feature{myfeature} state=resume\fR or
\fBPartitionName=p1 Nodes=feature{myfeature}\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBGres\fR
A comma\-delimited list of generic resources specifications for a node.
The format is: "<name>[:<type>][:no_consume]:<number>[K|M|G]".
The first field is the resource name, which matches the GresType configuration
parameter name.
The optional type field might be used to identify a model of that generic
resource.
It is forbidden to specify both an untyped GRES and a typed GRES with the same
<name>.
The optional no_consume field allows you to specify that a
generic resource does not have a finite number of that resource that gets
consumed as it is requested. The no_consume field is a GRES specific setting
and applies to the GRES, regardless of the type specified.
It should not be used with GRES that has a dedicated plugin, if you're looking
for a way to overcommit GPUs to multiple processes at the time you may be
interested in using "shard" GRES instead.
The final field must specify a generic resources count.
A suffix of "K", "M", "G", "T" or "P" may be used to multiply the number by
1024, 1048576, 1073741824, etc. respectively.
(e.g."Gres=gpu:tesla:1,gpu:kepler:1,bandwidth:lustre:no_consume:4G").
By default a node has no generic resources and its maximum count is
that of an unsigned 64bit integer.
Also see \fBFeatures\fR for Boolean flags to filter nodes using job constraints.
.IP

.TP
\fBMemSpecLimit\fR
Amount of \fBRealMemory\fR, in megabytes, reserved for system use and not
available for user allocations. Must be less than the amount defined for
\fBRealMemory\fR.
If the task/cgroup plugin is configured and that plugin constrains memory
allocations (i.e. the \fItask/cgroup\fR \fBTaskPlugin\fR is enabled and
\fBConstrainRAMSpace=yes\fR is set in cgroup.conf), then the slurmd will be
allocated the specified memory limit. If cgroup/v1 is used the slurmstepd will
also be allocated the specified memory limit. If cgroup/v2 is used, the
slurmstepd's consumption is completely dependent on the topology of the job.
Note that having the Memory set in \fBSelectTypeParameters\fR as any of the
options that has it as a consumable resource is needed for this option to work.
The daemons will not be killed if they exhaust the memory allocation
(i.e. the Out\-Of\-Memory Killer is disabled for the daemon's memory cgroup).
If the task/cgroup plugin is not configured, the specified memory will only be
unavailable for user allocations.
.IP

.TP
\fBPort\fR
The port number that the Slurm compute node daemon, \fBslurmd\fR, listens
to for work on this particular node. By default there is a single port number
for all \fBslurmd\fR daemons on all compute nodes as defined by the
\fBSlurmdPort\fR configuration parameter. Use of this option is not generally
recommended except for development or testing purposes. If multiple
\fBslurmd\fR daemons execute on a node this can specify a range of ports.

\fBNOTE\fR: On Cray systems, Realm\-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will
automatically try to interact with anything opened on ports 8192\-60000.
Configure Port to use a port outside of the configured SrunPortRange and
RSIP's port range.

\fBRealMemory\fR
Size of real memory on the node in megabytes (e.g. "2048").
The default value is 1. Lowering RealMemory with the goal of setting
aside some amount for the OS and not available for job allocations
will not work as intended if Memory is not set as a consumable
resource in \fBSelectTypeParameters\fR. So one of the *_Memory
options need to be enabled for that goal to be accomplished.

\fBRestrictedCoresPerGPU\fR
Number of cores per GPU restricted for only GPU use. If a job does not request a
GPU it will not have access to these cores.

\fBNOTE\fR: Configuring multiple GPU types on overlapping sockets can result in
erroneous GPU type and restricted core pairings in allocations requesting gpus

node that matches the same configuration (sockets, cores, threads) as reported
by \fBslurmd\fR \-C. The node's NodeAddr and NodeHostname will automatically be
retrieved from the \fBslurmd\fR and will be cleared when set back to the FUTURE
state.

\fBUNKNOWN\fP
Indicates the node's state is undefined but will be established
(set to \fIBUSY\fR or \fIIDLE\fR) when the \fBslurmd\fR daemon on that
node registers. \fIUNKNOWN\fR is the default state.

.TP
\fBThreadsPerCore\fR
Number of logical threads in a single physical core (e.g. "2").
Note that the Slurm can allocate resources to jobs down to the
resolution of a core. If your system is configured with more than
one thread per core, execution of a different job on each thread
is not supported unless you configure \fBSelectTypeParameters=CR_CPU\fR
plus \fBCPUs\fR; do not configure \fBSockets\fR, \fBCoresPerSocket\fR or
\fBThreadsPerCore\fR.
A job can execute a one task per thread from within one job step or
execute a distinct job step on each of the threads.
Note also if you are running with more than 1 thread per core and running
the select/cons_tres plugin then you will want to set
the SelectTypeParameters
variable to something other than CR_CPU to avoid unexpected results.
The default value is 1.
.IP

.TP
\fBTmpDisk\fR
Total size of temporary disk storage in \fBTmpFS\fR in megabytes
(e.g. "16384"). \fBTmpFS\fR (for "Temporary File System")
identifies the location which jobs should use for temporary storage.
Note this does not indicate the amount of free
space available to the user on the node, only the total file
system size. The system administration should ensure this file
system is purged as needed so that user jobs have access to
most of this space.
The Prolog and/or Epilog programs (specified in the configuration file)
might be used to ensure the file system is kept clean.
The default value is 0.
.IP

.TP
\fBTopology\fR
Comma-separated list of pairs in the format
\fR\fI<topology_name>\fR\fB:\fR\fI<topology_unit>\fR.
Where <\fItopology_unit\fR> is the block name or the name of a leaf switch.
Intermediate switch names -- ':' delimited -- can be provided and will be
created if needed (e.g. Topology=topo-tree:sw_root:s1:s2).
This setting overwrites the node topology affiliation configuration specified
in \fBtopology.conf\fR(5) and \fBtopology.yaml\fR(5).

.IP

.TP
\fBWeight\fR
The priority of the node for scheduling purposes.
All things being equal, jobs will be allocated the nodes with
the lowest weight which satisfies their requirements.
For example, a heterogeneous collection of nodes might
be placed into a single partition for greater system
utilization, responsiveness and capability. It would be
preferable to allocate smaller memory nodes rather than larger
memory nodes if either will satisfy a job's requirements.
The units of weight are arbitrary, but larger weights
should be assigned to nodes with more processors, memory,
disk space, higher processor speed, etc.
Note that if a job allocation request can not be satisfied
using the nodes with the lowest weight, the set of nodes
with the next lowest weight is added to the set of nodes
under consideration for use (repeat as needed for higher
weight values). If you absolutely want to minimize the number
of higher weight nodes allocated to a job (at a cost of higher
scheduling overhead), give each node a distinct \fBWeight\fR
value and they will be added to the pool of nodes being
considered for scheduling individually.

The default value is 1.

\fBNOTE\fR: Node weights are first considered among currently available
nodes. For example, POWERED_DOWN and POWERING_UP nodes with lower weights will
not be evaluated before a powered up IDLE node.
.IP

.SH "DOWN NODE CONFIGURATION"
The \fBDownNodes=\fR parameter permits you to mark certain nodes as in a

The default value is \fIDOWN\fR.
.IP

.SH "NODESET CONFIGURATION"
The nodeset configuration allows you to define a name for a specific set of
nodes which can be used to simplify the partition configuration section,
especially for heterogeneous or condo\-style systems. Each nodeset may be defined
by an explicit list of nodes, and/or by filtering the nodes by a particular
configured feature. If both \fBFeature=\fR and \fBNodes=\fR are used the
nodeset shall be the union of the two subsets.
Note that the nodesets are only used to simplify the partition definitions
at present, and are not usable outside of the partition configuration.

.TP
\fBFeature\fR
All nodes with this feature will be included as part of this nodeset. Only a
single feature is allowed.
.IP

.TP
\fBNodes\fR
List of nodes in this set.
.IP

.TP
\fBNodeSet\fR
Unique name for a set of nodes. Must not overlap with any NodeName definitions.
.IP

.SH "PARTITION CONFIGURATION"
The partition configuration permits you to establish different job
limits or access controls for various groups (or partitions) of nodes.
Nodes may be in more than one partition, making partitions serve
as general purpose queues.
For example one may put the same set of nodes into two different
partitions, each with different constraints (time limit, job sizes,
groups allowed to use the partition, etc.).
Jobs are allocated resources within a single partition.
Default values can be specified with a record in which
\fBPartitionName\fR is "DEFAULT".
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "PartitionName=DEFAULT".
The "PartitionName=" specification must be placed on every line
describing the configuration of partitions.
Each line where \fBPartitionName\fR is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous
default values and not reinitialize the default values.
A single partition name can not appear as a PartitionName value in more than
one line (duplicate partition name records will be ignored).
If a partition that is in use is deleted from the configuration and slurm
is restarted or reconfigured (scontrol reconfigure), jobs using the partition
are canceled.
\fBNOTE\fR: Put all parameters for each partition on a single line.
Each line of partition configuration information should
represent a different partition.
The partition configuration file contains the following information:

.TP
\fBAllocNodes\fR
Comma\-separated list of nodes from which users can submit jobs in the
partition.
Node names may be specified using the node range expression syntax
described above.
The default value is "ALL".
.IP

.TP
\fBAllowAccounts\fR
Comma\-separated list of accounts which may execute jobs in the partition.
The default value is "ALL". This list is hierarchical, meaning subaccounts
are included automatically.
\fBNOTE\fR: If AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced.
Also refer to DenyAccounts.
.IP

.TP
\fBAllowGroups\fR
Comma\-separated list of group names which may execute jobs in this
partition.
A user will be permitted to submit a job to this partition if
AllowGroups has \fBat least one\fR group associated with the user.
Jobs executed as user root or as user SlurmUser will be allowed to
use any partition, regardless of the value of AllowGroups. In addition, a Slurm
Admin or Operator will be able to view any partition, regardless of the value
of AllowGroups.
If user root attempts to execute a job as another user (e.g. using
srun's \-\-uid option), then the job will be subject to AllowGroups as if it
were submitted by that user.
By default, AllowGroups is unset, meaning all groups are allowed to use this
partition. The special value 'ALL' is equivalent to this.
Users who are not members of the specified group will not see information
about this partition by default. However, this should not be treated as a
security mechanism, since job information will be returned if a user requests
details about the partition or a specific job. See the \fBPrivateData\fR
parameter to restrict access to job information.
\fBNOTE\fR: For performance reasons, Slurm maintains a list of user IDs
allowed to use each partition and this is checked at job submission time.
This list of user IDs is updated when the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon is restarted,
reconfigured (e.g. "scontrol reconfig") or the partition's \fBAllowGroups\fR
value is reset, even if is value is unchanged
(e.g. "scontrol update PartitionName=name AllowGroups=group").
For a user's access to a partition to change, both his group membership must
change and Slurm's internal user ID list must change using one of the methods
described above.
.IP

.TP
\fBAllowQos\fR
Comma\-separated list of Qos which may execute jobs in the partition.
Jobs executed as user root can use any partition without regard to
the value of AllowQos.
The default value is "ALL".
\fBNOTE\fR: If AllowQos is used then DenyQos will not be enforced.
Also refer to DenyQos.
.IP

.TP
\fBAlternate\fR
Partition name of alternate partition to be used if the state of this partition

\fBCpuBind\fR
If a job step request does not specify an option to control how tasks are bound
to allocated CPUs (by using \-\-cpu\-bind) and all nodes allocated to the job
do not have the same \fBCpuBind\fR option for the node, then the partition's
\fBCpuBind\fR option will control how tasks are bound to allocated resources.
The \fBTaskPluginParam\fR will be used as a last resort, with the default being
no binding. Supported values for CpuBind are \fBnone\fR, \fBsocket\fR,
\fBldom\fR (NUMA), \fBcore\fR and \fBthread\fR.

\fBDefMemPerCPU\fR
Default real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.
Used to avoid over\-subscribing memory and causing paging.
\fBDefMemPerCPU\fR would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs (\fBSelectType=select/cons_tres\fR).
If not set, the \fBDefMemPerCPU\fR value for the entire cluster will be used.
Also see \fBDefMemPerGPU\fR, \fBDefMemPerNode\fR and \fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR.
\fBDefMemPerCPU\fR, \fBDefMemPerGPU\fR and \fBDefMemPerNode\fR are mutually
exclusive.

.TP
\fBDefMemPerGPU\fR
Default real memory size available per allocated GPU in megabytes.
Please note a best effort attempt is made to predict which GPUs on the system

\fBDefMemPerNode\fR
Default real memory size available per allocated node in megabytes.
Used to avoid over\-subscribing memory and causing paging.
\fBDefMemPerNode\fR would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs (\fBSelectType=select/linear\fR) and
resources are over\-subscribed (\fBOverSubscribe=yes\fR or
\fBOverSubscribe=force\fR).
If not set, the \fBDefMemPerNode\fR value for the entire cluster will be used.

Also refer AllowQos.
.IP

.TP
\fBDisableRootJobs\fR
If set to "YES" then user root will be prevented from running any jobs
on this partition.
The default value will be the value of \fBDisableRootJobs\fR set
outside of a partition specification (which is "NO", allowing user
root to execute jobs).
.IP

.TP
\fBExclusiveTopo\fR
If set to "YES," then only one job may be run on a single topology segment.
This capability is also available on a per\-job basis by using the
\fB\-\-exclusive=topo\fR option.
.IP

.TP
\fBExclusiveUser\fR
If set to "YES" then nodes will be exclusively allocated to users.
Multiple jobs may be run for the same user, but only one user can be active
at a time.
This capability is also available on a per\-job basis by using the
\fB\-\-exclusive=user\fR option.
.IP

.TP
\fBGraceTime\fR
Specifies, in units of seconds, the preemption grace time
to be extended to a job which has been selected for preemption.
This parameter only takes effect when \fBPreemptType=partition_prio\fR.
The default value is zero, no preemption grace time is allowed on
this partition.
Once a job has been selected for preemption, its end time is set to the current
time plus GraceTime. The job's tasks are immediately sent SIGCONT and SIGTERM
signals in order to provide notification of its imminent termination.
This is followed by the SIGCONT, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signal sequence upon
reaching its new end time. This second set of signals is sent to both the
tasks \fBand\fR the containing batch script, if applicable.
See also the global \fBKillWait\fR configuration parameter.
.br

.IP

.TP
\fBHidden\fR
Specifies if the partition and its jobs are to be hidden by default.
Hidden partitions will by default not be reported by the Slurm APIs or commands.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
The default value is "NO".
Note that partitions that a user lacks access to by virtue of the
\fBAllowGroups\fR parameter will also be hidden by default.
.IP

.TP
\fBLLN\fR
Schedule resources to jobs on the least loaded nodes (based upon the number
of idle CPUs). This is generally only recommended for an environment with
serial jobs as idle resources will tend to be highly fragmented, resulting
in parallel jobs being distributed across many nodes.
Note that node \fBWeight\fR takes precedence over how many idle resources are
on each node.
Also see the \fBSelectTypeParameters\fR configuration parameter \fBCR_LLN\fR to
use the least loaded nodes in every partition.
.IP

.TP
\fBMaxCPUsPerNode\fR
Maximum number of CPUs on any node available to all jobs from this partition.
This can be especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node can be
associated with two Slurm partitions (e.g. "cpu" and "gpu") and the
partition/queue "cpu" could be limited to only a subset of the node's CPUs,
ensuring that one or more CPUs would be available to jobs in the "gpu"
partition/queue.

\fBMaxTime\fR
Maximum run time limit for jobs.
Format is minutes, minutes:seconds, hours:minutes:seconds,
days\-hours, days\-hours:minutes, days\-hours:minutes:seconds or

\fBMinNodes\fR
Minimum count of nodes which may be allocated to any single job.
The default value is 0.

\fBNodes\fR
Comma\-separated list of nodes or nodesets which are associated with this
partition.
Node names may be specified using the node range expression syntax
described above. A blank list of nodes
(i.e. Nodes="") can be used if one wants a partition to exist,
but have no resources (possibly on a temporary basis).
A value of "ALL" is mapped to all nodes configured in the cluster.
.IP

.TP
\fBOverSubscribe\fR
Controls the ability of the partition to execute more than one job at a
time on each resource (node, socket or core depending upon the value
of \fBSelectTypeParameters\fR).
If resources are to be over\-subscribed, avoiding memory over\-subscription
is very important.
\fBSelectTypeParameters\fR should be configured to treat
memory as a consumable resource and the \fB\-\-mem\fR option
should be used for job allocations.
Sharing of resources is typically useful only when using gang scheduling
(\fBPreemptMode=suspend,gang\fR).
Possible values for \fBOverSubscribe\fR are "EXCLUSIVE", "FORCE", "YES", and "NO".
Note that a value of "YES" or "FORCE" can negatively impact performance

\fBEXCLUSIVE\fR
Allocates entire nodes to jobs even with \fBSelectType=select/cons_tres\fR
configured.
Jobs that run in partitions with \fBOverSubscribe=EXCLUSIVE\fR will have
exclusive access to all allocated nodes.
These jobs are allocated all CPUs and GRES on the nodes, but they are only
allocated as much memory as they ask for. This is by design to support gang
scheduling, because suspended jobs still reside in memory. To request all the
memory on a node, use \fB\-\-mem=0\fR at submit time.
.IP

.TP
\fBFORCE\fR
Makes all resources (except GRES) in the partition available for
oversubscription without any means for users to disable it.
May be followed with a colon and maximum number of jobs in
running or suspended state.
For example \fBOverSubscribe=FORCE:4\fR enables each node, socket or
core to oversubscribe each resource four ways.
Recommended only for systems using \fBPreemptMode=suspend,gang\fR.

\fBNOTE\fR: \fBOverSubscribe=FORCE:1\fR is a special case that is not exactly
equivalent to \fBOverSubscribe=NO\fR. \fBOverSubscribe=FORCE:1\fR disables
the regular oversubscription of resources in the same partition but it will
still allow oversubscription due to preemption or on overlapping partitions
with the same PriorityTier. Setting \fBOverSubscribe=NO\fR
will prevent oversubscription from happening in all cases.

\fBNOTE\fR: If using \fBPreemptType=preempt/qos\fR you can specify a value for
\fBFORCE\fR that is greater than 1. For example, \fBOverSubscribe=FORCE:2\fR
will permit two jobs per resource normally, but a third job can be started
only if done so through preemption based upon QOS.

\fBNOTE\fR: If \fBOverSubscribe\fR is configured to \fBFORCE\fR or \fBYES\fR
in your slurm.conf and the system is not configured to use preemption
(\fBPreemptMode=OFF\fR) accounting can easily grow to values greater than
the actual utilization. It may be common on such systems to get error messages
in the slurmdbd log stating: "We have more allocated time than is possible."
.IP

.TP
\fBYES\fR
Makes all resources (except GRES) in the partition available for sharing upon
request by the job.
Resources will only be over\-subscribed when explicitly requested
by the user using the "\-\-oversubscribe" option on job submission.
May be followed with a colon and maximum number of jobs in
running or suspended state.
For example "OverSubscribe=YES:4" enables each node, socket or
core to execute up to four jobs at once.
Recommended only for systems running with gang scheduling
(\fBPreemptMode=suspend,gang\fR).
.IP

.TP
\fBNO\fR
Selected resources are allocated to a single job. No resource will be
allocated to more than one job.

\fBNOTE\fR: Even if you are using \fBPreemptMode=suspend,gang\fR, setting

\fBOverSubscribe=FORCE:1\fR if you want to disable normal oversubscription
but still allow suspension due to preemption.
.RE

\fBOverTimeLimit\fR
Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before
being canceled.
Normally a job's time limit is treated as a \fIhard\fR limit and the job will be
killed upon reaching that limit.
Configuring \fBOverTimeLimit\fR will result in the job's time limit being
treated like a \fIsoft\fR limit.
Adding the \fBOverTimeLimit\fR value to the \fIsoft\fR time limit provides a
\fIhard\fR time limit, at which point the job is canceled.
This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon
each job's soft time limit.
If not set, the \fBOverTimeLimit\fR value for the entire cluster will be used.
May not exceed 65533 minutes.
A value of "UNLIMITED" is also supported.

\fBPowerDownOnIdle\fR
If set to "YES" and power saving is enabled for the partition, then nodes

\fBPreemptMode\fR
Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling for this
partition when \fBPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR is configured.
This partition\-specific \fBPreemptMode\fR configuration parameter will
override the cluster\-wide \fBPreemptMode\fR for this partition.
It can be set to OFF to disable preemption and gang scheduling for this

The \fBGANG\fR option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of
whether preemption is enabled (i.e. independent of the \fBPreemptType\fR

\fBNOTE\fR:
For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs,
not partial nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more
other jobs, the whole nodes for those preempted jobs are reserved for the
preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer resources than that.
These reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may
preempt more resources during a single backfill iteration than they requested.

Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so
if you only want time\-slicing by \fBOverSubscribe\fR, without any preemption,
then configuring partitions with overlapping nodes is not recommended.
On the other hand, if you want to use \fBPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR
to allow jobs from higher PriorityTier partitions to Suspend jobs from lower
PriorityTier partitions you will need overlapping partitions, and
\fBPreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG\fR to use the Gang scheduler to resume the suspended

\fBSUSPEND\fR
The preempted jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume

will still use memory on the allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to track
memory resources to be able to suspend jobs.

If the preemptees and preemptor are on different partitions then the preempted
jobs will remain suspended until the preemptor ends.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: Because gang scheduling is performed independently for each
partition, if using \fBPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR then jobs in
higher PriorityTier partitions will suspend jobs in lower PriorityTier
partitions to run on the released resources. Only when the preemptor job ends
will the suspended jobs will be resumed by the Gang scheduler.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: Suspended jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not
be able to preempt to gain access to GRES.

\fBPriorityJobFactor\fR
Partition factor used by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority.
Defaults to 1. A value of 0 prevents this partition from adding to the job's
priority. The value may not exceed 65533.
Also see PriorityTier.
.IP

.TP
\fBPriorityTier\fR
Jobs submitted to a partition with a higher \fBPriorityTier\fR value will be
evaluated by the scheduler before pending jobs in a partition with a lower
\fBPriorityTier\fR value. They will also be considered for preemption of running
jobs in partition(s) with lower \fBPriorityTier\fR values if
\fIPreemptType=preempt/partition_prio\fR.
The value may not exceed 65533.
Also see PriorityJobFactor.
.IP

.TP
\fBQOS\fR
Used to extend the limits available to a QOS on a partition. Jobs will not be
associated to this QOS outside of being associated to the partition. They
will still be associated to their requested QOS.
By default, no QOS is used.
Additional details are in the QOS documentation at
<https://slurm.schedmd.com/qos.html>, including special conditions
when a relative QOS is used for this parameter.
\fBNOTE\fR: If a limit is set in both the Partition's QOS and the Job's QOS,
the Partition QOS limit will be honored unless the Job's QOS has the
\fBOverPartQOS\fR flag set, in which case the Job's QOS limit will take
precedence.
.IP

.TP
\fBReqResv\fR
Specifies users of this partition are required to designate a reservation
when submitting a job. This option can be useful in restricting usage
of a partition that may have higher priority or additional resources to be
allowed only within a reservation.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
The default value is "NO".
.IP

.TP
\fBResumeTimeout\fR
Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node resume request
is issued and when the node is actually available for use.
Nodes which fail to respond in this time frame will be marked DOWN and
the jobs scheduled on the node requeued if possible.
Nodes which reboot after this time frame will be marked DOWN with a reason of
"Node unexpectedly rebooted."
For nodes that are in multiple partitions with this option set,
the highest time will take effect. If not set on any partition, the node will
use the \fBResumeTimeout\fR value set for the entire cluster. The maximum value
is either 65533 or INFINITE.
.IP

.TP
\fBRootOnly\fR
Specifies if only user ID zero (i.e. user \fIroot\fR) may allocate resources
in this partition. User root may allocate resources for any other user,
but the request must be initiated by user root.
This option can be useful for a partition to be managed by some
external entity (e.g. a higher\-level job manager) and prevents
users from directly using those resources.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
The default value is "NO".
.IP

\fBSelectTypeParameters\fR
Partition\-specific resource allocation type.
This option replaces the global \fBSelectTypeParameters\fR value.
Supported values are \fBCR_Core\fR, \fBCR_Core_Memory\fR, \fBCR_Socket\fR and
\fBCR_Socket_Memory\fR.
Use requires the system\-wide \fBSelectTypeParameters\fR value be set to
any of the four supported values previously listed; otherwise, the

\fBTRESBillingWeights\fR
TRESBillingWeights is used to define the billing weights of each tracked TRES
type (see \fBAccountingStorageTRES\fR) that
will be used in calculating the usage of a job. The calculated usage is used
when calculating fairshare and when enforcing the TRES billing limit on jobs.

Billing weights are specified as a comma\-separated list of
\fI<TRES Type>\fR=\fI<TRES Billing Weight>\fR pairs.

Any TRES Type is available for billing. Note that the base unit for memory and
burst buffers is megabytes.

By default the billing of TRES is calculated as the sum of all TRES types
multiplied by their corresponding billing weight.

The weighted amount of a resource can be adjusted by adding a suffix of K,M,G,T
or P after the billing weight. For example, a memory weight of "mem=.25" on a
job allocated 8GB will be billed 2048 (8192MB *.25) units. A memory weight of
"mem=.25G" on the same job will be billed 2 (8192MB * (.25/1024)) units.

Negative values are allowed.

When a job is allocated 1 CPU and 8 GB of memory on a partition configured with
TRESBillingWeights="CPU=1.0,Mem=0.25G,GRES/gpu=2.0,license/licA=1.5", the
billable TRES will be: (1*1.0) + (8*0.25) + (0*2.0) + (0*1.5) = 3.0.

If PriorityFlags=MAX_TRES is configured, the billable TRES is calculated as the
MAX of individual TRESs on a node (e.g. cpus, mem, gres) plus the sum of all
global TRESs (e.g. licenses). Using the same example above the billable TRES
will be MAX(1*1.0, 8*0.25, 0*2.0) + (0*1.5) = 2.0.

If TRESBillingWeights is not defined then the job is billed against the total
number of allocated CPUs.

\fBNOTE\fR: TRESBillingWeights doesn't affect job priority directly as it is
currently not used for the size of the job. If you want TRESs to play a role in
the job's priority then refer to the PriorityWeightTRES option.

.SH "PROLOG AND EPILOG SCRIPTS"
There are a variety of prolog and epilog program options that
execute with various permissions and at various times.
The four options most likely to be used are:
\fBProlog\fR and \fBEpilog\fR (executed once on each compute node
for each job) plus \fBPrologSlurmctld\fR and \fBEpilogSlurmctld\fR
(executed once on the \fBControlMachine\fR for each job).

\fBNOTE\fR: Standard output and error messages are normally not preserved.
Explicitly write output and error messages to an appropriate location
if you wish to preserve that information.

\fBNOTE\fR: By default the Prolog script is ONLY run on any individual
node when it first sees a job step from a new allocation. It does not
run the Prolog immediately when an allocation is granted. If no job steps
from an allocation are run on a node, it will never run the Prolog for that
allocation. This Prolog behavior can be changed by the
\fBPrologFlags\fR parameter. The Epilog, on the other hand, always
runs on every node of an allocation when the allocation is released.

If the Epilog fails (returns a non\-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state.
If the EpilogSlurmctld fails (returns a non\-zero exit code), this will only
be logged.
If the Prolog fails (returns a non\-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state and the job being requeued. The job will be
placed in a held state unless \fBnohold_on_prolog_fail\fR is configured in
\fBSchedulerParameters\fR.
If the PrologSlurmctld fails (returns a non\-zero exit code), this will result
in the job being requeued to be executed on another node if possible. Only
batch jobs can be requeued.
Interactive jobs (salloc and srun) will be cancelled if the
PrologSlurmctld fails.
If slurmctld is stopped while either PrologSlurmctld or EpilogSlurmctld is
running, the script will be killed with SIGKILL. The script will restart when
slurmctld restarts.

Information about the job is passed to the script using environment
variables. For a full list of environment variables please see the Prolog
and Epilog Guide <https://slurm.schedmd.com/prolog_epilog.html>.

.SH "UNKILLABLE STEP PROGRAM SCRIPT"
This program can be used to take special actions to clean up the unkillable
processes and/or notify system administrators.
The program will be run as \fBSlurmdUser\fR (usually "root") on the compute
node where \fBUnkillableStepTimeout\fR was triggered.

Information about the unkillable job step is passed to the script using
environment variables.

.TP
\fBSLURM_JOB_ID\fR
Job ID.
.IP

.TP
\fBSLURM_STEP_ID\fR
Job Step ID. Note that the special steps "batch", "interactive", and "extern"
are reported not by name but with integer Step IDs 4294967291, 4294967290, and
4294967292 respectively.

.SH "NETWORK TOPOLOGY"
Slurm is able to optimize job allocations to minimize network contention.
Special Slurm logic is used to optimize allocations on systems with a
three\-dimensional interconnect.
and information about configuring those systems are available on
web pages available here: <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>.
For a hierarchical network, Slurm needs to have detailed information
about how nodes are configured on the network switches.
.LP
The \fBTopologyPlugin\fR parameter controls which plugin is used to
collect network topology information.
The only values presently supported are
"topology/flat" (best\-fit logic over one\-dimensional topology),
"topology/tree", and "topology/block" (both determine the network topology
based upon information contained in a topology.conf or topology.yaml file,
see "man topology.conf" and "man topology.yaml" for more information).
Future plugins may gather topology information directly from the network.
The topology information is optional.
If not provided, Slurm will perform a best\-fit algorithm assuming the
nodes are in a one\-dimensional array as configured and the communications
cost is related to the node distance in this array.

.SH "RELOCATING CONTROLLERS"
If the cluster's computers used for the primary or backup controller
will be out of service for an extended period of time, it may be
desirable to relocate them.
In order to do so, follow this procedure:
.LP
1. Stop the Slurm daemons on the old controller and nodes.
.br
2. Modify the slurm.conf file appropriately.
.br
3. Copy the files from the StateSaveLocation to the new controller or ensure
that they are accessible to the new controller via a shared drive.
.br
4. Distribute the updated slurm.conf file to all nodes.
.br
5. Restart the Slurm daemons on the new controller and nodes.
.LP
There should be no loss of any pending jobs. Any running jobs will get the
updated host info and finish normally.
Ensure that any nodes added to the cluster have the current
slurm.conf file installed.
.LP
\fBCAUTION:\fR If two nodes are simultaneously configured as the
primary controller (two nodes on which \fBSlurmctldHost\fR specify
the local host and the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon is executing on each),
system behavior will be destructive.
If a compute node has an incorrect \fBSlurmctldHost\fR
parameter, that node may be rendered
unusable, but no other harm will result.

.SH "LOGGING"
.LP
Note that while Slurm daemons create log files and other files as needed,
it treats the lack of parent directories as a fatal error.
This prevents the daemons from running if critical file systems are
not mounted and will minimize the risk of cold\-starting (starting
without preserving jobs).
.LP
Log files and job accounting files
may need to be created/owned by the "SlurmUser" uid to be successfully
accessed. Use the "chown" and "chmod" commands to set the ownership
and permissions appropriately.
See the section \fBFILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS\fR for information
about the various files and directories used by Slurm.

It is recommended that the logrotate utility be used to ensure that
various log files do not become too large.
This also applies to text files used for accounting,
