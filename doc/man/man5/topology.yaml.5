.SH "NAME"
topology.yaml \-  Slurm configuration file for the topology plugins

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.LP
\fBtopology.yaml\fR is a YAML\-formatted configuration file that defines
multiple network topologies for optimizing job resource allocation in Slurm.
The file must be located in the same directory as \fBslurm.conf\fR. Any text
following a "#" in this file is treated as a comment through the end of that
line.

Additional details are available in \fBtopology.conf\fR(5) and in the
Topology Guide: <https://slurm.schedmd.com/topology.html>

\fBNOTE\fR: Slurm will first check for topology.yaml.
If this file exists, topology.conf will be ignored.
.LP

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.LP
Each topology contains the following attributes:
.LP

.TP
\fBtopology\fR
Unique name of the topology, will be used to identify it on partition
configurations. Must be the first attribute.
.IP

.TP
\fBcluster_default\fR
The first topology defined with \fBcluster_default: true\fR will be used for
partitions without an explicitly specified topology and cluster-wide operations
not tied to a partition (e.g., slurmctld-to-slurmd communication). Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR.
.IP

.LP
Each topology must also define exactly one of the following topology types:
.RS
.TP
\fBblock\fR
This topology will use the \fBtopology/block\fR plugin. Must contain additional
fields, see below.
.IP

.TP
\fBflat\fR
If set to \fBtrue\fR, this topology will use the \fBtopology/flat\fR plugin,
which is the default if no TopologyPlugin or topology.yaml is specified.
.IP

.TP
\fBtree\fR
This topology will use the \fBtopology/tree\fR plugin. Must contain additional
fields, see below.
.IP
.RE

.SS "Block definitions"
.LP
Each block topology contains the following attributes:
.LP

.TP
\fBblock_sizes\fR
List of the planning base block size, alongside any
higher-level block sizes that would be enforced.
Successive \fBBlockSizes\fR must be a power of two larger than the prior values.
.IP

.TP
\fBblocks\fR
List of blocks available in this topology. Each block contains the following
attributes:

.RS
.TP
\fBblock\fR
The name of a block. This name is internal to Slurm and arbitrary.
Each block should have a unique name.
This field must be specified.
.IP

.TP
\fBnodes\fR
Child nodes of the named block.
.IP
.RE
.IP

.SS "Tree definitions"
.LP
Each tree topology contains the following attribute:
.LP

.TP
\fBswitches\fR
List of switches available in this topology. Each switch contains the following
attributes:

.RS
.TP
\fBswitch\fR
The name of a switch. This name is internal to Slurm and arbitrary.
Each switch should have a unique name.
This field must be specified and cannot be longer than 64 characters.
.IP

.TP
\fBchildren\fR
Child switches of the named switch.
.IP

.TP
\fBnodes\fR
Child nodes of the named leaf switch.
.IP
