.SH "NAME"
slurmdbd.conf \- Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBslurmdb.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes Slurm Database
Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable.
.LP
The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes
and files. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SlurmDbd or daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless otherwise noted.
.LP
This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and
should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g. "slurm").
If the slurmdbd daemon is started as user root and changes to another
user ID, the configuration file will initially be read as user root, but will
be read as the other user ID in response to a SIGHUP signal.
This file should be protected from unauthorized access since it
contains a database password.
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBArchiveDir\fR
If ArchiveScript is not set the slurmdbd will generate a file that can be
read in anytime with sacctmgr load filename.  This directory is where the
file will be placed after a purge event has happened and archive for that
element is set to true.  Default is /tmp.  The format for this files name is
.na
$ArchiveDir/$ClusterName_$ArchiveObject_archive_$BeginTimeStamp_$endTimeStamp
.ad

.TP
\fBArchiveEvents\fR
When purging events also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive event data,
no otherwise.  Default is no.

.TP
\fBArchiveJobs\fR
When purging jobs also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive job data,
no otherwise.  Default is no.

.TP
\fBArchiveResvs\fR
When purging reservations also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive
reservation data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

.TP
\fBArchiveScript\fR
This script can be executed every time a rollup happens (every hour,
day and month), depending on the Purge*After options.  This script is used
to transfer accounting records out of the database into an archive.  It is
used in place of the internal process used to archive objects.
The script is executed with a no arguments, The following environment
variables are set.
.RS

.TP
\fBArchiveSteps\fR
When purging steps also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive step data,
no otherwise.  Default is no.

.TP
\fBArchiveSuspend\fR
When purging suspend data also archive it.  Boolean, yes to archive
suspend data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

.TP
\fBArchiveTXN\fR
When purging transaction data also archive it.  Boolean, yes to archive
transaction data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

.TP
\fBArchiveUsage\fR
When purging usage data (Cluster, Association and WCKey) also archive it.
Boolean, yes to archive transaction data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

.TP
\fBAuthInfo\fR
Additional information to be used for authentication of communications
with the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld) on each cluster.
The interpretation of this option is specific to the configured \fBAuthType\fR.
In the case of \fIauth/munge\fR, this can be configured to use a Munge daemon
specifically configured to provide authentication between clusters while the
default Munge daemon provides authentication within a cluster.
In that case, this will specify the pathname of the socket to use. Per default
this value is left unspecified, which results in the default authentication
mechanism being used.

.TP
\fBAuthType\fR
Define the authentication method for communications between Slurm
components.
Acceptable values at present include "auth/none" and "auth/munge".
The default value is "auth/munge".
\fBDo not use "auth/none" if you desire any security\fR.
"auth/munge" indicates that LLNL's MUNGE system is to be used
(this is the supported authentication mechanism for Slurm;
see "https://dun.github.io/munge/" for more information).
SlurmDBD must be terminated prior to changing the value of \fBAuthType\fR
and later restarted.

.TP
\fBCommitDelay\fR
How many seconds between commits on a connection from a Slurmctld.  This
speeds up inserts into the database dramatically.  If you are running a very
high throughput of jobs you should consider setting this.  In testing, 1 second
improves the slurmdbd performance dramatically and reduces overhead.  There is
a small probability of data loss though since this creates a window in which
if the slurmdbd seg faults or exits abnormally for any reason the data not
committed could be lost.  While this situation should be very rare,
it does present an extremely small risk, but may be the only way to run in
extremely heavy environments.  In all honesty, the risk is quite low, but still
present.

.TP
\fBDbdBackupHost\fR
The short, or long, name of the machine where the backup Slurm Database Daemon
is executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname \-s").
This host must have access to the same underlying database specified by
the 'Storage' options mentioned below.

.TP
\fBDbdAddr\fR
Name that \fBDbdHost\fR should be referred to in establishing a communications
path. This name will be used as an argument to the gethostbyname() function for
identification. For example, "elx0000" might be used to designate the Ethernet
address for node "lx0000".  By default the \fBDbdAddr\fR will be identical in
value to \fBDbdHost\fR.

.TP
\fBDbdHost\fR
The short, or long, name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is
executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname \-s").
This value must be specified.

.TP
\fBDbdPort\fR
The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens
to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system
build time. If none is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.
This value must be equal to the \fBAccountingStoragePort\fR parameter in the
slurm.conf file.

.TP
\fBDebugFlags\fR
Defines specific subsystems which should provide more detailed event logging.
Multiple subsystems can be specified with comma separators.
Most DebugFlags will result in verbose logging for the identified subsystems
and could impact performance.
Valid subsystems available today (with more to come) include:

\fBPurgeEventAfter\fR
Events happening on the cluster over this age are purged from the database.
This includes node down times and such.
The time is a numeric value and is a number of months.  If you want to purge
more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get
those more frequent purges (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge
everything older than 12 hours).
The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.
For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the
beginning of each month.
If not set (default), then job step records are never purged.

.TP

.TP
\fBSlurmUser\fR
The name of the user that the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon executes as.
This user must exist on the machine executing the Slurm Database Daemon
and have the same user ID as the hosts on which \fBslurmctld\fR execute.
For security purposes, a user other than "root" is recommended.
The default value is "root".

to store the data.
Ideally this should be the host on which slurmdbd executes.

.TP
\fBStorageBackupHost\fR
Define the name of the backup host the database is running where we are going
to store the data.  This can be viewed as a backup solution when the
StorageHost is not responding.  It is up to the backup solution to enforce the
coherency of the accounting information between the two hosts. With clustered
database solutions (active/passive HA), you would not need to use this feature.
Default is none.

\fBStorageLoc\fR
Specify the name of the database as the location where accounting
records are written. Defaults to "slurm_acct_db".

.TP
\fBStoragePass\fR
Define the password used to gain access to the database to store
the job accounting data. The '#' character is not permitted in a password.

.TP
\fBStoragePort\fR

should be written to a MySQL or MariaDB database specified by the
\fBStorageLoc\fR parameter.
This value must be specified.

.TP
\fBStorageUser\fR
Define the name of the user we are going to connect to the database
with to store the job accounting data.

\fBTCPTimeout\fR
Time permitted for TCP connection to be established. Default value is 2 seconds.

.TP
\fBTrackWCKey\fR
Boolean yes or no.  Used to set display and track of the Workload
Characterization Key. Must be set to track wckey usage.  This must be set to
generate rolled up usage tables from WCKeys.
NOTE: If TrackWCKey is set here and not in your various slurm.conf files all
jobs will be attributed to their default WCKey.

.TP
\fBTrackSlurmctldDown\fR
Boolean yes or no.  If set the slurmdbd will mark all idle resources on the
cluster as down when a slurmctld disconnects or is no longer reachable.  The
default is no.
