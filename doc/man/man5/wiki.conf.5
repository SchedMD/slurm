.SH "NAME"
wiki.conf \- Slurm configuration file for wiki and wiki2 scheduler plugins
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBwiki.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes wiki and wiki2
scheduler specific SLURM configuration information.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 4096 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
.LP
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBAuthKey\fR
Authentication key for communications.
This should be no more than a 32\-bit unsigned integer and match the
KEY configured in the \fBmoab\-private.cnf\fR file (for the Moab Scheduler)
or the \fB\-\-with-key=\fR value used to configure the Maui Scheduler.

.TP
\fBEHost\fR
Name the computer on which Moab server executes.
It is used in establishing a communications path for event notification.
By default \fBEHost\fR will be identical in value to the
\fBControlAddr\fR configured in slurm.conf.
Not applicable to wiki plugin, only the wiki2 plugin.

.TP
\fBEHostBackup\fR
Name the computer on which the backup Moab server executes.
It is used in establishing a communications path for event notification.
By default \fBEHostBackup\fR will be identical in value to the
\fBBackupAddr\fR configured in slurm.conf.
Not applicable to wiki plugin, only the wiki2 plugin.

.TP
\fBEPort\fR
Port to be used to notify Moab of events (job submitted to SLURM,
job terminates, etc.).
This numeric value should match EPORT configured in the
\fBmoab.cnf\fR file.
Not applicable to wiki plugin, only the wiki2 plugin.

.TP
\fBExcludePartitions\fR
Identifies partitions whose jobs are to be scheduled directly
by SLURM rather than Moab/Maui.
This only effects jobs which are submitted using SLURM
commands (i.e. srun, salloc or sbatch, NOT msub from Moab).
These jobs will be scheduled on a First\-Come\-First\-Served
basis directly by SLURM.
Note that SLURM recognizes jobs submitted via msub based
upon the value \fBFirstJobId\fR configured in \fIslurm.conf\fR.
Set the values \fBMINJOBID\fR and \fBMAXJOBID\fR in \fImoab.cfg\fR
accordingly.
For example MINJOBID=1, MAXJOBID=65535 and FirstJobId=65536.
Jobs submitted using msub will have job ID values in the range
of 1 and 65535 while jobs submitted directly using SLURM commands
will have a job ID of 65536 or higher.
Moab/Maui controls for resource reservation, fair share
scheduling, etc. will not apply to the initiation of these jobs.
While Moab/Maui will not control the initiation of jobs in these
partitions, it will account for and report the jobs.
If more than one partition is to be scheduled directly by
SLURM, use a comma separator between their names.
This may provide faster response times than Moab/Maui scheduling.

.TP
\fBHidePartitionJobs\fR
Identifies partitions whose jobs are not to be reported to Moab/Maui.
These jobs will not be accounted for or otherwise visible to Moab/Maui.
Any partitions listed here must also be listed in \fBExcludePartitions\fR.
This only effects jobs which are submitted using SLURM commands (i.e.
\fIsrun\fR, \fIsalloc\fR or \fIsbatch\fR, NOT \fImsub\fR from Moab).
If more than one partition is to have its jobs hidden, use a comma
separator between their names.

.TP
\fBHidePartitionNodes\fR
Identifies partitions whose nodes are not to be reported to Moab/Maui.
Nodes which are configured only in hidden partitions will not be accounted
for or otherwise visible to Moab/Maui.
Any partitions included here will normally also be included in the
\fBExcludePartitions\fR and \fBHidePartitionJobs\fR parameters.
If more than one partition is to have its jobs hidden, use a comma
separator between their names.

.TP
\fBHostFormat\fR
Controls the format of host lists exchanged between SLURM and Moab.
The default value is "0".
Not applicable to wiki plugin, only the wiki2 plugin.

.RS
.TP
\fB0\fR
No data compression. Each host name is listed individually.
.TP
\fB1\fR
SLURM hostlist expressions are exchanged with task counts
(e.g. "tux[0\-16]*2") in job state information and job
initiation requests.
.TP
\fB2\fR
SLURM hostlist expressions are used to report node state information.
.RE

.TP
\fBJobAggregationTime\fR
This is used to avoid notifying Moab of large numbers of events
occuring about the same time.
If an event occurs within this number of seconds since Moab was
last notified of an event, another notification is not sent.
This should be an integer number of seconds.
The default value is 10 seconds.
The value should match JOBAGGREGATIONTIME configured in the
\fBmoab.cnf\fR file.
Not applicable to wiki plugin, only the wiki2 plugin.

.TP
\fBJobPriority\fR
Controls initial job priority.
The default value is "hold".
Not applicable to wiki plugin, only the wiki2 plugin.
.RS
.TP
\fBrun\fR
Job permitted to run directly under SLURM's control
.TP
\fBhold\fR
Hold all incoming jobs until Moab or Maui tell them to run
.RE
