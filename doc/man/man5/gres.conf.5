.SH "NAME"
gres.conf \- Slurm configuration file for generic resource management.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgres.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes the configuration
of generic resources on each compute node. Each node must contain a
gres.conf file if generic resources are to be scheduled by SLURM.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file. If generic resource counts are
set by the gres plugin function node_config_load(), this file may be optional.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
.LP
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBCount\fR
Number of resources of this type available on this node.
The default value is set to the number of \fBFile\fR values specified (if any),
otherwise the default value is one. A suffix of "K", "M" or "G" may be used
to multiply the number by 1024, 1048576 or 1073741824 respectively.
Note that Count is a 32\-bit field and the maximum value is 4,294,967,295.
 
.TP
\fBCPUs\fR
Specify the CPU index numbers for the specific CPUs which can
use this resource.
For example, it may be strongly preferable
to use specific CPUs with specific devices (e.g. on a NUMA
architecture). Multiple CPUs may be specified using a comma
delimited list or a range may be specified using a "\-" separator
(e.g. "0,1,2,3" or "0\-3").
If specified, then only the identified CPUs can be allocated with each generic
resource; an attempt to use other CPUs will not be honored.
If not specified, then any CPU can be used with the resources, which also
increases the speed of Slurm's scheduling algorithm.
If any CPU can be effectively used with the resources, then do not specify the
\fBCPUs\fR option for improved speed in the SLURM scheduling logic.

Since SLURM must be able to perform resource management on heterogeneous
clusters having various CPU ID numbering schemes, use the SLURM CPU index
numbers here
(CPU_ID = Board_ID x threads_per_board +
Socket_ID x threads_per_socket +
Core_ID x threads_per_core + Thread_ID).

.TP
\fBFile\fR
Fully qualified pathname of the device files associated with a resource. 
The file name parsing logic does not include any support for regular
expressions. Each file must be explicitly named, one per line.
This field is generally required if enforcement of generic resource
allocations is to be supported (i.e. prevents a users from making
use of resources allocated to a different user).
If \fBFile\fR is specified then \fBCount\fR must be either set to the number
of file names specified or not set (the default value is the number of files
specified).
Slurm must track the utilization of each individual device If device file
names are specified, which involves more overhead than just tracking the
device counts.
Use the \fBFile\fR parameter only if the \fBCount\fR is not sufficient for
tracking purposes.
NOTE: If you specify the \fBFile\fR parameter for a resource on some node,
the option must be specified on all nodes and SLURM will track the assignment
of each specific resource on each node. Otherwise SLURM will only track a
count of allocated resources rather than the state of each individual device
file.

.TP
\fBName\fR
Name of the generic resource. Any desired name may be used.
Each generic resource has an optional plugin which can provide
resource\-specific options.
Generic resources that currently include an optional plugin are:
.RS
.TP
\fBgpu\fR
Graphics Processing Unit
.TP
\fBnic\fR
Network Interface Card
.TP
\fBmic\fR
Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) processor
.RE

.TP
\fBNodeName\fR
An optional NodeName specification can be used to permit one gres.conf file to
be used for all compute nodes in a cluster by specifying the node(s) that each
line should apply to.
The NodeName specification can use a Slurm hostlist specification as shown in
the example below.

.TP
\fBType\fR
An arbitrary string identifying the type of device.
For example, a particular model of GPU.
If \fBType\fR is specified, then \fBCount\fR is limited in size (currently 1024).
