.SH "NAME"
topology.conf \- Slurm configuration file for defining the network topology

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBtopology.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes the
cluster's network topology for optimized job resource allocation.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 4096 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
.LP
The network topology configuration one one line defining a switch name and
its children, either node names or switch names.
SLURM's hostlist expression parser is used, so the node and switch
names need not be consecutive (e.g. "Nodes=tux[0\-3,12,18\-20]"
and "Switches=s[0\-2,4\-8,12]" will parse fine).
An optional link speed may also be specified.
.LP
The \fBtopology.conf\fP file for an Infiniband switch can be automatically
generated using the \fBib2slurm\fP tool found here:
<https://github.com/fintler/ib2slurm>.
.LP
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBSwitchName\fR
The name of a switch. This name is internal to SLURM and arbitrary.
Each switch should have a unique name.
This field must be specified.
.TP
\fBSwitches\fR
Child switches of the named switch.
Either this option or the \fBNodes\fR option must be specified.
.TP
\fBNodes\fR
Child Nodes of the named leaf switch.
Either this option or the \fBSwitches\fR option must be specified.
.TP
\fBLinkSpeed\fR
An optional value specifying the performance of this communication link.
The units used are arbitrary and this information is currently not used.
It may be used in the future to optimize resource allocations.
