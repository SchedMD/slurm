.SH "NAME"
acct_gather.conf \- Slurm configuration file for the acct_gather plugins

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBacct_gather.conf\fP is an ASCII file which defines parameters used by
Slurm's acct_gather related plugins.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.

.LP
The following acct_gather.conf parameters are defined to control the general
behavior of various plugins in SLURM.

.LP
The acct_gather.conf file is different than other Slurm .conf files.  Each
plugin defines which options are available.  So if you do not load the
respective plugin for an option that option will appear to be unknown by Slurm
and could cause Slurm not to load.  If you decide to change plugin types you
might also have to change the related options as well.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMI\fR
Options used for AcctGatherEnergyType/ipmi are as follows:

.RS
.TP 20
\fBEnergyIPMIFrequency\fR=<number>
This parameter is the number of seconds between BMC access samples.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMICalcAdjustment\fR=<yes|no>
If set to "yes", the consumption between the last BMC access sample and
a step consumption update is approximated to get more accurate task consumption.
The adjustment is made at the step start and each time the
consumption is updated, including the step end. The approximations are not
accumulated, only the first and last adjustments are used to calculated the
consumption. The default is "no".

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMIPowerSensor\fR=<number>
This parameter is optional.  If the parameter is included, the plugin searches
the node for a "watt" sensor with the number specified by <number>. If a
matching sensor is found, that sensor is used for power data. If no matching
sensor is found, a value of zero is returned for power data. If the parameter
is omitted, the plugin will use the first "watt" sensor it finds.

.LP
The following acct_gather.conf parameters are defined to control the
IPMI config default values for libipmiconsole.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMIUsername\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify BMC Username.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMIPassword\fR=\fIPASSWORD\fR
Specify BMC Password.

.TP
\fBProfileHDF5\fR
Options used for AcctGatherProfileType/hdf5 are as follows:

.RS
.TP 20
\fBProfileHDF5Dir\fR=<path>
This parameter is the path to the shared folder into which the
acct_gather_profile plugin will write detailed data (usually as an HDF5 file).
The directory is assumed to be on a file system shared by the controller and
all compute nodes. This is a required parameter.

.TP
\fBProfileHDF5Default\fR
A comma delimited list of data types to be collected for each job submission.
Allowed values are:

.RS
.TP
\fBAll\fR All data types are collected. (Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBNone\fR No data types are collected. This is the default.
 (Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBEnergy\fR Energy data is collected.

.TP
\fBTask\fR Task (I/O, Memory, ...) data is collected.

.TP
\fBLustre\fR Lustre data is collected.

.TP
\fBNetwork\fR Network (InfiniBand) data is collected.
.RE
.RE

.TP
\fBInfinibandOFED\fR
Options used for AcctGatherInfinbandType/ofed are as follows:

.RS
.TP 20
\fBInfinibandOFEDFrequency\fR=<number>
This parameter is the number of seconds between the calls to infiniband counters.

.TP
\fBInfinibandOFEDPort\fR=<number>
This parameter represents the port number of the local Infiniband card that we are willing to monitor.
The default port is 1.
