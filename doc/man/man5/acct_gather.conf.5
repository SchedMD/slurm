.SH "NAME"
acct_gather.conf \- Slurm configuration file for the acct_gather plugins

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBacct_gather.conf\fP is an ASCII file which defines parameters used by
Slurm's acct_gather related plugins.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.

.LP
The following acct_gather.conf parameters are defined to control the general
behavior of various plugins in Slurm.

.LP
The acct_gather.conf file is different than other Slurm .conf files.  Each
plugin defines which options are available.  So if you do not load the
respective plugin for an option that option will appear to be unknown by Slurm
and could cause Slurm not to load.  If you decide to change plugin types you
might also have to change the related options as well.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMI\fR
Options used for AcctGatherEnergyType/ipmi are as follows:

.RS
.TP 10
\fBEnergyIPMIFrequency\fR=<number>
This parameter is the number of seconds between BMC access samples.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMICalcAdjustment\fR=<yes|no>
If set to "yes", the consumption between the last BMC access sample and
a step consumption update is approximated to get more accurate task consumption.
The adjustment is made at the step start and each time the
consumption is updated, including the step end. The approximations are not
accumulated, only the first and last adjustments are used to calculated the
consumption. The default is "no".

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMIPowerSensors\fR=<key=values>\fR
Optionally specify the ids of the sensors to used.
Multiple <key=values> can be set with ";" separators.
The key "Node" is mandatory and is used to know the consumed energy for nodes
(scontrol show node) and jobs (sacct).
Other keys are optional and are named by administrator.
These keys are useful only when profile is activated for energy to store power
(in watt) of each key.
<values> are integers, multiple values can be set with "," separators.
The sum of the listed sensors is used for each key.
EnergyIPMIPowerSensors is optional, default value is "Node=number" where
"number" is the id of the first power sensor returned by ipmi-sensors.

.na
EnergyIPMIPowerSensors=Node=16,19,23,26;Socket0=16,23;Socket1=19,26;SSUP=23,26;KNC=16,19

.LP
The following acct_gather.conf parameters are defined to control the
IPMI config default values for libipmiconsole.

.TP 10
\fBEnergyIPMIUsername\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify BMC Username.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMIPassword\fR=\fIPASSWORD\fR
Specify BMC Password.

.TP
\fBProfileHDF5\fR
Options used for AcctGatherProfileType/hdf5 are as follows:

.RS
.TP 10
\fBProfileHDF5Dir\fR=<path>
This parameter is the path to the shared folder into which the
acct_gather_profile plugin will write detailed data (usually as an HDF5 file).
The directory is assumed to be on a file system shared by the controller and
all compute nodes. This is a required parameter.

.TP
\fBProfileHDF5Default\fR
A comma delimited list of data types to be collected for each job submission.
Allowed values are:

.RS
.TP 8
\fBAll\fR
All data types are collected. (Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBNone\fR
No data types are collected. This is the default.
(Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBEnergy\fR
Energy data is collected.

.TP
\fBFilesystem\fR
File system (Lustre) data is collected.

.TP
\fBNetwork\fR
Network (InfiniBand) data is collected.

.TP
\fBTask\fR
Task (I/O, Memory, ...) data is collected.

.RE
.RE
.TP
\fBProfileInfluxDB\fR
Options used for AcctGatherProfileType/influxdb are as follows:

.RS
.TP 10
\fBProfileInfluxDBDatabase\fR
InfluxDB database name where profiling information is to be written.

.TP
\fBProfileInfluxDBDefault\fR
A comma delimited list of data types to be collected for each job submission.
Allowed values are:

.RS
.TP 8
\fBAll\fR
All data types are collected. (Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBNone\fR
No data types are collected. This is the default.
(Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBEnergy\fR
Energy data is collected.

.TP
\fBFilesystem\fR
File system (Lustre) data is collected.

.TP
\fBNetwork\fR
Network (InfiniBand) data is collected.

.TP
\fBTask\fR
Task (I/O, Memory, ...) data is collected.
.RE

.TP
\fBProfileInfluxDBHost\fR=<hostname>:<port>
The hostname of the machine where the influxd instance is executed and the port
used by the HTTP API. The port used by the HTTP API is the one configured
through the bind-address influxdb.conf option in the [http] section. Example:

ProfileInfluxDBHost=myinfluxhost:8086

.TP
\fBProfileInfluxDBPass\fR
Optional password for username configured in ProfileInfluxDBUser.

.TP
\fBProfileInfluxDBRTPolicy\fR
The InfluxDB retention policy name for the database configured in
ProfileInfluxDBDatabase option.

.TP
\fBProfileInfluxDBUser\fR
Optinal InfluxDB username that should be used to gain access to the database
configured in ProfileInfluxDBDatabase. This is only needed InfluxDB is
configured with authentication enabled in the [http] config section and a user
has been granted at least WRITE access to the database. See also
ProfileInfluxDBPass.
.RE

.TP
NOTE:
This plugin requires the libcurl development files to be installed.
.TP
NOTE:
Information on how to install and configure InfluxDB and manage databases,
retention policies and such is available on the official webpage.
.TP
NOTE:
Collected information is written from every compute node where a job runs to
the influxd instance listening on the ProfileInfluxDBHost. In order to avoid
overloading the influxd instance with incoming connection requests, the plugin
uses an internal buffer which is filled with samples. Once the buffer is full, a
HTTP API write request is performed and the buffer is emptied to hold subsequent
samples. A final request is also performed when a task ends even if the buffer
isn't full.
.TP
NOTE:
Failed HTTP API write requests are discarded. This means that collected profile
information in the plugin buffer is lost if it can't be written to the influxd
database for any reason.
.TP
NOTE:
Plugin messages are logged along with the slurmstepd logs to SlurmdLogFile. In
order to troubleshoot any issues, it is recommended to temporarily increase
the slurmd debug level to debug3 and add Profile to the debug flags. This can
be accomplished by setting the slurm.conf SlurmdDebug and DebugFlags
respectively or dynamically through scontrol setdebug and setdebugflags.
.TP
NOTE:
Perhaps it's a good idea to use a monitoring and analytics tool such as Grafana
on top of InfluxDB. This kind of tools permit to create dashboards, tables, and
other graphics using the stored time series. This way, it is easier to correlate
resource usage peaks reported by other node monitoring tools such as Ganglia
with specific job step tasks.

.TP
\fBInfinibandOFED\fR
Options used for AcctGatherInfinbandType/ofed are as follows:

.RS
.TP 10
\fBInfinibandOFEDPort\fR=<number>
This parameter represents the port number of the local Infiniband card that we are willing to monitor.
The default port is 1.
