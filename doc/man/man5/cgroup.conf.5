"Slurm cgroup configuration file"

.SH "NAME"
cgroup.conf \- Slurm configuration file for the cgroup support

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB/etc/slurm/cgroup.conf\fP is an ASCII file which defines parameters used by 
Slurm's Linux cgroup related plugins. The file will always be located in 
the same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
.LP
Two cgroup plugins are currently available in SLURM. The first
one is a proctrack plugin, the second one a task plugin.

.LP
The following cgroup.conf parameters are defined to control the general behavior
of Slurm cgroup plugins.

.TP
\fBCgroupMountpoint\fR=\fIPATH\fR
Specify the \fIPATH\fR under which cgroups should be mounted. This
should be a writeable directory which will contain cgroups mounted
one per subsystem. The default \fIPATH\fR is /cgroup.

.TP
\fBCgroupAutomount\fR=<yes|no>
Slurm cgroup plugins require valid and functional cgroup subsystem to be mounted
under /cgroup/<subsystem_name>.
When launched, plugins check their subsystem availability. If not available, 
the plugin launch fails unless CgroupAutomount is set to yes. In that case, the 
plugin will first try to mount the required subsystems.

.TP
\fBCgroupReleaseAgentDir\fR=<path_to_release_agent_directory>
Used to tune the cgroup system behavior. This parameter identifies the location 
of the directory containing Slurm cgroup release_agent files. A release_agent file
is required for each mounted subsystem. The release_agent file name must have the
following format: release_<subsystem_name>.  For instance, the release_agent file
for the cpuset subsystem must be named release_cpuset.  See also CLEANUP OF
CGROUPS below.

.SH "PROCTRACK/CGROUP PLUGIN"

Slurm \fBproctrack/cgroup\fP plugin is used to track processes using the
freezer control group subsystem. It creates a hierarchical set of
directories for each step, putting the step tasks into the leaf.
.LP
This directory structure is like the following:
.br 
/cgroup/freezer/uid_%uid/job_%jobid/step_%stepid
.LP
Slurm cgroup proctrack plugin is enabled with the following parameter
in slurm.conf:
.br 
ProctrackType=proctrack/cgroup

.LP
No particular cgroup.conf parameter is defined to control the behavior
of this particular plugin.


.SH "TASK/CGROUP PLUGIN"

.LP
Slurm \fBtask/cgroup\fP plugin is used to enforce allocated resources 
constraints, thus avoiding tasks to use unallocated resources. It currently
only uses cpuset subsystem but could use memory and devices subsystems in a 
near future too.

.LP
It creates a hierarchical set of directories for each task and subsystem.
The directory structure is like the following:
.br 
/cgroup/%subsys/uid_%uid/job_%jobid/step_%stepid/task_%taskid

.LP
Slurm cgroup task plugin is enabled with the following parameter
in slurm.conf:
.br
TaskPlugin=task/cgroup

.LP
The following cgroup.conf parameters are defined to control the behavior
of this particular plugin:

.TP
\fBConstrainCores\fR=<yes|no>
If configured to "yes" then constrain allowed cores to the subset of 
allocated resources. It uses the cpuset subsystem.
The default value is "no".
.TP
\fBTaskAffinity\fR=<yes|no>
If configured to "yes" then set a default task affinity to bind each step 
task to a subset of the allocated cores using \fBsched_setaffinity\fP.
The default value is "no".

.LP
The following cgroup.conf parameters could be defined to control the behavior
of this particular plugin in a next version where memory and devices support
would be added :

.TP
\fBAllowedRAMSpace\fR=<number>
Constrain the job cgroup RAM to this percentage of the allocated memory.
The default value is 100. If SLURM is not allocating memory to jobs,
The percentage supplied may be expressed as floating point
number, e.g. 98.5. If the \fBAllowedRAMSpace\fR limit is exceeded, the
job steps will be killed and a warning message will be written to standard
error.  Also see \fBConstrainRAMSpace\fR.

.TP
\fBAllowedSwapSpace\fR=<number>
Constrain the job cgroup swap space to this percentage of the allocated
memory.  The default value is 0, which means that RAM+Swap will be limited
to \fBAllowedRAMSpace\fR. The supplied percentage may be expressed as a
floating point number, e.g. 50.5.  If the limit is exceeded, the job steps
will be killed and a warning message will be written to standard error.
Also see \fBConstrainSwapSpace\fR.

.TP
\fBConstrainRAMSpace\fR=<yes|no>
If configured to "yes" then constrain the job's RAM usage.
The default value is "no".
Also see \fBAllowedRAMSpace\fR.

.TP
\fBConstrainSwapSpace\fR=<yes|no>
If configured to "yes" then constrain the job's swap space usage.
The default value is "no".
Also see \fBAllowedSwapSpace\fR.

.TP
\fBMaxRAMPercent\fR=\fIPERCENT\fR
Set an upper bound in percent of total RAM on the RAM constraint for a job.
This will be the memory constraint applied to jobs that are not explicitly
allocated memory by SLURM. The \fIPERCENT\fR may be an arbitrary floating
point number. The default value is 100.

.TP
\fBMaxSwapPercent\fR=\fIPERCENT\fR
Set an upper bound (in percent of total RAM) on the amount of RAM+Swap
that may be used for a job. This will be the swap limit applied to jobs
on systems where memory is not being explicitly allocated to job. The
\fIPERCENT\fR may be an arbitrary floating point number between 0 and 100.
The default value is 100.

.TP
\fBMinRAMSpace\fR=<number>
Set a lower bound (in MB) on the memory limits defined by
\fBAllowedRAMSpace\fR and \fBAllowedSwapSpace\fR. This prevents
accidentally creating a memory cgroup with such a low limit that slurmstepd
is immediately killed due to lack of RAM. The default limit is 30M.

.TP
\fBConstrainDevices\fR=<yes|no>
If configured to "yes" then constrain the job's allowed devices based on GRES
allocated resources. It uses the devices subsystem for that.
The default value is "no".

.TP
\fBAllowedDevicesFile\fR=<path_to_allowed_devices_file>
If the ConstrainDevices field is set to "yes" then this file has to be used to declare 
the devices that need to be allowed by default for all the jobs. The current implementation 
of cgroup devices subsystem works as a whitelist of entries, which means that in order to
isolate the access of a job upon particular devices we need to allow the access on all
the devices, supported by default and then deny on those that the job does not have the 
permission to use. The default value is "/etc/slurm/cgroup_allowed_devices_file.conf". The syntax of 
the file accepts one device per line and it permits lines like /dev/sda* or /dev/cpu/*/*. 
See also an example of this file in etc/allowed_devices_file.conf.example.

.SH "NOTES"
.LP
Only one instance of a cgroup subsystem is valid at a time in the kernel.
If you try to mount another cgroup hierarchy that uses the same cpuset 
subsystem it will fail.
However you can mount another cgroup hierarchy for a different cpuset 
subsystem.

.SH CLEANUP OF CGROUPS
.LP
To allow cgroups to be removed automatically when they are no longer in use
the notify_on_release flag is set in each cgroup when the cgroup is
instantiated. The release_agent file for each subsystem is set up when the
subsystem is mounted.  The name of each release_agent file is 
release_<subsystem name>. The directory is specified via the 
CgroupReleaseAgentDir parameter in cgroup.conf. A simple release agent 
mechanism to remove slurm cgroups when they become empty may be set up by 
creating the release agent files for each required subsystem as symbolic 
links to a common release agent script, as shown in the example below:

[sulu] (slurm) etc> cat cgroup.conf | grep CgroupReleaseAgentDir
.br
CgroupReleaseAgentDir="/etc/slurm/cgroup"
.br

[sulu] (slurm) etc> ls -al /etc/slurm/cgroup
