.br
);
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.LP
.TP
\fIslurm_step_alloc_req_msg_ptr\fP
Specifies the pointer to the structure with job step request specification. See
slurm.h for full details on the data structure's contents.
.TP
\fIslurm_step_alloc_resp_msg_pptr\fP
Specifies the double pointer to the structure to be created and filled with a description of the
created job step: node allocation, credentials, etc. See slurm.h for full details on the data
structure's contents.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
\fBslurm_free_job_step_create_response_msg\fR Release the storage generated in response
to a call of the function \fBslurm_job_step_create\fR.
.LP
\fBslurm_job_step_create\fR Initialize a job step including the allocation of nodes to
it from those already allocate to that job. Always release the response message when no
longer required using the function \fBslurm_free_job_step_create_response_msg\fR.
The list of host names returned may be matched to their data in the proper order by
using the functions \fBhostlist_create\fR, \fBhostlist_shift\fR, and
\fBhostlist_destroy\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.LP
On success, zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and Slurm error code is set appropriately.
.SH "ERRORS"
.LP
\fBSLURM_PROTOCOL_VERSION_ERROR\fR Protocol version has changed, re\-link your code.
.LP
\fBESLURM_INVALID_JOB_ID\fR the requested job id does not exist.
.LP
\fBESLURM_ALREADY_DONE\fR the specified job has already completed and can not be modified.
.LP
\fBESLURM_ACCESS_DENIED\fR the requesting user lacks authorization for the requested action (e.g. trying to delete or modify another user's job).
.LP
\fBESLURM_DISABLED\fR the ability to create a job step is currently disabled.
This is indicative of the job being suspended. Retry the call as desired.
.LP
\fBESLURM_INTERCONNECT_FAILURE\fR failed to configure the node interconnect.
.LP
\fBESLURM_BAD_DIST\fR task distribution specification is invalid.
.LP
\fBSLURM_PROTOCOL_SOCKET_IMPL_TIMEOUT\fR Timeout in communicating with
SLURM controller.

.SH "NOTE"
These functions are included in the libslurm library,
which must be linked to your process for use
(e.g. "cc \-lslurm myprog.c").
