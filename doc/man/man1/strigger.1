.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBstrigger \-\-set\fR   [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

\fBstrigger \-\-clear\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBstrigger\fR is used to set, get or clear Slurm trigger information.
Triggers include events such as a node failing, a job reaching its
time limit or a job terminating.
These events can cause actions such as the execution of an arbitrary
script.
Typical uses include notifying system administrators of node failures
and gracefully terminating a job when its time limit is approaching.
A hostlist expression for the nodelist or job ID is passed as an argument
to the program.

Trigger events are not processed instantly, but a check is performed for
trigger events on a periodic basis (currently every 15 seconds).
Any trigger events which occur within that interval will be compared
against the trigger programs set at the end of the time interval.
The trigger program will be executed once for any event occurring in
that interval.
The record of those events (e.g. nodes which went DOWN in the previous
15 seconds) will then be cleared.
The trigger program must set a new trigger before the end of the next
interval to ensure that no trigger events are missed OR the trigger must be
created with an argument of "\-\-flags=PERM".
If desired, multiple trigger programs can be set for the same event.

\fBIMPORTANT NOTE:\fR This command can only set triggers if run by the
user \fISlurmUser\fR unless \fISlurmUser\fR is configured as user root.
This is required for the \fIslurmctld\fR daemon to set the appropriate
user and group IDs for the executed program.
Also note that the trigger program is executed on the same node that the
\fIslurmctld\fR daemon uses rather than some allocated compute node.
To check the value of \fISlurmUser\fR, run the command:

\fIscontrol show config | grep SlurmUser\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-clear\fP
Clear or delete a previously defined event trigger.
The \fB\-\-id\fR, \fB\-\-jobid\fR or \fB\-\-user\fR
option must be specified to identify the trigger(s) to
be cleared.
Only user root or the trigger's creator can delete a trigger.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-down\fR
Trigger an event if the specified node goes into a DOWN state.

.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-drained\fR
Trigger an event if the specified node goes into a DRAINED state.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-primary_slurmctld_acct_buffer_full\fR
Trigger an event when primary slurmctld accounting buffer is full.

.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-fail\fR
Trigger an event if the specified node goes into a FAILING state.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fini\fR
Trigger an event when the specified job completes execution.

.TP
\fB\-\-flags\fR=\fItype\fR
Associate flags with the reservation. Multiple flags should be comma separated.
Valid flags include:
.RS
.TP
PERM
Make the trigger permanent. Do not purge it after the event occurs.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-\-front_end\fR
Trigger events based upon changes in state of front end nodes rather than
compute nodes. Applies to Cray ALPS architectures only, where the
slurmd daemon executes on front end nodes rather than the compute nodes.
Use this option with either the \fB\-\-up\fR or \fB\-\-down\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-primary_slurmdbd_failure\fR
Trigger an event when the primary slurmdbd fails. The trigger is launched by
slurmctld in the occasions it tries to connect to slurmdbd, but receives no
response on the socket.

.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-primary_slurmdbd_resumed_operation\fR
Trigger an event when the primary slurmdbd resumes operation after failure.
This event is triggered when opening the connection from slurmctld to slurmdbd
results in a response. It can happen also in different situations, periodically
every 15 seconds when checking the connection status, when saving state,
when agent queue is filling, and so on.

.TP
\fB\-\-get\fP
Show registered event triggers.
Options can be used for filtering purposes.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-primary_database_failure\fR
Trigger an event when the primary database fails. This event is triggered when
the accounting plugin tries to open a connection with mysql and it fails and
the slurmctld needs the database for some operations.

.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-primary_database_resumed_operation\fR
Trigger an event when the primary database resumes operation after failure.
It happens when the connection to mysql from the accounting plugin is restored.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-id\fR=\fIid\fR
Trigger ID number.

.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-idle\fR
Trigger an event if the specified node remains in an IDLE state
for at least the time period specified by the \fB\-\-offset\fR
option. This can be useful to hibernate a node that remains idle,
thus reducing power consumption.

.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobid\fR=\fIid\fR
Job ID of interest.
\fBNOTE:\fR The \fB\-\-jobid\fR option can not be used in conjunction
with the \fB\-\-node\fR option. When the \fB\-\-jobid\fR option is
used in conjunction with the \fB\-\-up\fR or \fB\-\-down\fR option,
all nodes allocated to that job will considered the nodes used as a
trigger event.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-node\fR[=\fIhost\fR]
Host name(s) of interest.
By default, all nodes associated with the job (if \fB\-\-jobid\fR
is specified) or on the system are considered for event triggers.
\fBNOTE:\fR The \fB\-\-node\fR option can not be used in conjunction
with the \fB\-\-jobid\fR option. When the \fB\-\-jobid\fR option is
used in conjunction with the \fB\-\-up\fR, \fB\-\-down\fR or
\fB\-\-drained\fR option,
all nodes allocated to that job will considered the nodes used as a
trigger event. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper
parsing the single letter option must be followed immediately with
the value and not include a space between them. For example "\-ntux"
and not "\-n tux".

.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print the header when displaying a list of triggers.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-offset\fR=\fIseconds\fR
The specified action should follow the event by this time interval.
Specify a negative value if action should preceded the event.
The default value is zero if no \fB\-\-offset\fR option is specified.
The resolution of this time is about 20 seconds, so to execute
a script not less than five minutes prior to a job reaching its
time limit, specify \fB\-\-offset=320\fR (5 minutes plus 20 seconds).

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-program\fR=\fIpath\fR
Execute the program at the specified fully qualified pathname
when the event occurs.
You may quote the path and include extra program arguments if desired.
The program will be executed as the user who sets the trigger.
If the program fails to terminate within 5 minutes, it will
be killed along with any spawned processes.

.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Do not report non\-fatal errors.
This can be useful to clear triggers which may have already been purged.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reconfig\fR
Trigger an event when the system configuration changes.
This is triggered when the slurmctld daemon reads its configuration file or
when a node state changes.

.TP
\fB\-\-set\fP
Register an event trigger based upon the supplied options.
NOTE: An event is only triggered once. A new event trigger
must be set established for future events of the same type
to be processed.
Triggers can only be set if the command is run by the user
\fISlurmUser\fR unless \fISlurmUser\fR is configured as user root.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR
Trigger an event when the specified job's time limit is reached.
This must be used in conjunction with the \fB\-\-jobid\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-up\fR
Trigger an event if the specified node is returned to service
from a DOWN state.

.TP
\fB\-\-user\fR=\fIuser_name_or_id\fR
Clear or get triggers created by the specified user.
For example, a trigger created by user \fIroot\fR for a job created by user
\fIadam\fR could be cleared with an option \fI\-\-user=root\fR.
Specify either a user name or user ID.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print detailed event logging. This includes time\-stamps on data structures,
record counts, etc.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBstrigger\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmctld\fR. If
enough calls from \fBstrigger\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBstrigger\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to \fBslurmctld\fR from loops in shell scripts or other
programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to \fBstrigger\fR to the minimum
necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBstrigger\fR options may be set via environment variables. These
environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.
(Note: commandline options will always override these settings)
.TP 20
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the Slurm configuration file.
