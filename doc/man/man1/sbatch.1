.TH sbatch "1" "Slurm Commands" "February 2024" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sbatch \- Submit a batch script to Slurm.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsbatch\fR [\fIOPTIONS(0)\fR...] [ : [\fIOPTIONS(N)\fR...]] \fIscript(0)\fR [\fIargs(0)\fR...]

Option(s) define multiple jobs in a co\-scheduled heterogeneous job.
For more details about heterogeneous jobs see the document
.br
https://slurm.schedmd.com/heterogeneous_jobs.html

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
sbatch submits a batch script to Slurm.  The batch script may be given to
sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified,
sbatch will read in a script from standard input. The batch script may contain
options preceded with "#SBATCH" before any executable commands in the script.
sbatch will stop processing further #SBATCH directives once the first
non\-comment non\-whitespace line has been reached in the script.

sbatch exits immediately after the script is successfully transferred to the
Slurm controller and assigned a Slurm job ID.  The batch script is not
necessarily granted resources immediately, it may sit in the queue of pending
jobs for some time before its required resources become available.

By default both standard output and standard error are directed to a file of
the name "slurm\-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced with the job allocation
number. The file will be generated on the first node of the job allocation.
Other than the batch script itself, Slurm does no movement of user files.

When the job allocation is finally granted for the batch script, Slurm
runs a single copy of the batch script on the first node in the set of
allocated nodes.

The following document describes the influence of various options on the
allocation of cpus to jobs and tasks.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
sbatch will return 0 on success or error code on failure.

.SH "SCRIPT PATH RESOLUTION"

The batch script is resolved in the following order:
.br

1. If script starts with ".", then path is constructed as:
current working directory / script
.br
2. If script starts with a "/", then path is considered absolute.
.br
3. If script is in current working directory.
.br
4. If script can be resolved through PATH. See \fBpath_resolution\fR(7).
.br
.P
Current working directory is the calling process working directory unless the
\fB\-\-chdir\fR argument is passed, which will override the current working
directory.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP

.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-account\fR=<\fIaccount\fR>
Charge resources used by this job to specified account.
The \fIaccount\fR is an arbitrary string. The account name may
be changed after job submission using the \fBscontrol\fR
command.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-acctg\-freq\fR=<\fIdatatype\fR>=<\fIinterval\fR>[,<\fIdatatype\fR>=<\fIinterval\fR>...]
Define the job accounting and profiling sampling intervals in seconds.
This can be used to override the \fIJobAcctGatherFrequency\fR parameter in
the slurm.conf file.  <\fIdatatype\fR>=<\fIinterval\fR> specifies the task
sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugin or a
sampling interval for a profiling type by the
acct_gather_profile plugin. Multiple
comma\-separated <\fIdatatype\fR>=<\fIinterval\fR> pairs
may be specified. Supported \fIdatatype\fR values are:
.IP
.RS
.TP 12
\fBtask\fR
Sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugins and for task
profiling by the acct_gather_profile plugin.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: This frequency is used to monitor memory usage. If memory limits
are enforced, the highest frequency a user can request is what is configured
in the slurm.conf file.  It can not be disabled.
.IP

.TP
\fBenergy\fR
Sampling interval for energy profiling using the
acct_gather_energy plugin.
.IP

.TP
\fBnetwork\fR
Sampling interval for infiniband profiling using the
acct_gather_interconnect plugin.
.IP

.TP
\fBfilesystem\fR
Sampling interval for filesystem profiling using the
acct_gather_filesystem plugin.
.IP

.LP
The default value for the task sampling interval is 30 seconds.
The default value for all other intervals is 0.
An interval of 0 disables sampling of the specified type.
If the task sampling interval is 0, accounting
information is collected only at job termination (reducing Slurm
interference with the job).
.br
Smaller (non\-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance,
but a value of 30 seconds is not likely to be noticeable for
applications having less than 10,000 tasks.
.RE
.IP

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-array\fR=<\fIindexes\fR>
Submit a job array, multiple jobs to be executed with identical parameters.
The \fIindexes\fR specification identifies what array index values should
be used. Multiple values may be specified using a comma separated list and/or
a range of values with a "\-" separator. For example, "\-\-array=0\-15" or
"\-\-array=0,6,16\-32".
A step function can also be specified with a suffix containing a colon and
number. For example, "\-\-array=0\-15:4" is equivalent to "\-\-array=0,4,8,12".
A maximum number of simultaneously running tasks from the job array may be
specified using a "%" separator.
For example "\-\-array=0\-15%4" will limit the number of simultaneously
running tasks from this job array to 4.
The minimum index value is 0.
the maximum value is one less than the configuration parameter MaxArraySize.
\fBNOTE\fR: Currently, federated job arrays only run on the local cluster.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-batch\fR=<\fIlist\fR>
Nodes can have \fBfeatures\fR assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.
Users can specify which of these \fBfeatures\fR are required by their batch
script using this options.
For example a job's allocation may include both Intel Haswell and KNL nodes
with features "haswell" and "knl" respectively.
On such a configuration the batch script would normally benefit by executing
on a faster Haswell node.
This would be specified using the option "\-\-batch=haswell".
The specification can include AND and OR operators using the ampersand and
vertical bar separators. For example:
"\-\-batch=haswell|broadwell" or "\-\-batch=haswell|big_memory".
The \-\-batch argument must be a subset of the job's
\fB\-\-constraint\fR=<\fIlist\fR> argument (i.e. the job can not request only
KNL nodes, but require the script to execute on a Haswell node).
If the request can not be satisfied from the resources allocated to the job,
the batch script will execute on the first node of the job allocation.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-bb\fR=<\fIspec\fR>
Burst buffer specification. The form of the specification is system dependent.
Also see \fB\-\-bbf\fR.
When the \fB\-\-bb\fR option is used, Slurm parses this option and creates a
temporary burst buffer script file that is used internally by the burst buffer
plugins. See Slurm's burst buffer guide for more information and examples:
.br
https://slurm.schedmd.com/burst_buffer.html
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-bbf\fR=<\fIfile_name\fR>
Path of file containing burst buffer specification.
The form of the specification is system dependent.
These burst buffer directives will be inserted into the submitted batch script.
See Slurm's burst buffer guide for more information and examples:
.br
https://slurm.schedmd.com/burst_buffer.html
.IP

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-begin\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Submit the batch script to the Slurm controller immediately, like normal, but
tell the controller to defer the allocation of the job until the specified time.

Time may be of the form \fIHH:MM:SS\fR to run a job at
a specific time of day (seconds are optional).
(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)
You may also specify \fImidnight\fR, \fInoon\fR, \fIelevenses\fR (11 AM),
\fIfika\fR (3 PM) or \fIteatime\fR (4 PM) and you can have a time\-of\-day
suffixed with \fIAM\fR or \fIPM\fR for running in the morning or the evening.
You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying
a date of the form \fIMMDDYY\fR or \fIMM/DD/YY\fR
\fIYYYY\-MM\-DD\fR. Combine date and time using the following
format \fIYYYY\-MM\-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]\fR. You can also
give times like \fInow + count time\-units\fR, where the time\-units
can be \fIseconds\fR (default), \fIminutes\fR, \fIhours\fR,
\fIdays\fR, or \fIweeks\fR and you can tell Slurm to run
the job today with the keyword \fItoday\fR and to run the
job tomorrow with the keyword \fItomorrow\fR.
The value may be changed after job submission using the
\fBscontrol\fR command.
For example:
.IP
.nf
   \-\-begin=16:00
   \-\-begin=now+1hour
   \-\-begin=now+60           (seconds by default)
   \-\-begin=2010\-01\-20T12:34:00
.fi

.RS
.PP
Notes on date/time specifications:
 \- Although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is
allowed by the code, note that the poll time of the Slurm scheduler
is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of the job on the exact
second.  The job will be eligible to start on the next poll
following the specified time. The exact poll interval depends on the
Slurm scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default sched/builtin).
 \- If no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
 \- If a date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current
year is assumed, unless the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has
already passed for that year, in which case the next year is used.

\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-chdir\fR=<\fIdirectory\fR>
Set the working directory of the batch script to \fIdirectory\fR before
it is executed. The path can be specified as full path or relative path
to the directory where the command is executed.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-cluster\-constraint\fR=[!]<\fIlist\fR>
Specifies features that a federated cluster must have to have a sibling job
submitted to it. Slurm will attempt to submit a sibling job to a cluster if it
has at least one of the specified features. If the "!" option is included, Slurm
will attempt to submit a sibling job to a cluster that has none of the specified
features.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to.  Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.
The job will be submitted to the one cluster providing the earliest expected
job initiation time. The default value is the current cluster. A value of
\(aq\fIall\fR' will query to run on all clusters.  Note the
\fB\-\-export\fR option to control environment variables exported
between clusters.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-comment\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
An arbitrary comment enclosed in double quotes if using spaces or some
special characters.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint\fR=<\fIlist\fR>
Nodes can have \fBfeatures\fR assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.
Users can specify which of these \fBfeatures\fR are required by their job
using the constraint option. If you are looking for 'soft' constraints please
see \fB\-\-prefer\fR for more information.
Only nodes having features matching the job constraints will be used to
satisfy the request.
Multiple constraints may be specified with AND, OR, matching OR,
resource counts, etc. (some operators are not supported on all system types).

\fBNOTE\fR: Changeable features are features defined by a NodeFeatures plugin.

Supported \fB\-\-constraint\fR options include:
.IP
.PD 1
.RS
.TP
\fBSingle Name\fR
Only nodes which have the specified feature will be used.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel"\fR
.IP

.TP
\fBNode Count\fR
A request can specify the number of nodes needed with some feature
by appending an asterisk and count after the feature name.
For example, \fB\-\-nodes=16 \-\-constraint="graphics*4"\fR
indicates that the job requires 16 nodes and that at least four of those
nodes must have the feature "graphics."
If requesting more than one feature and using node counts, the request
must have square brackets surrounding it.

\fBNOTE\fR: This option is not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.
Heterogeneous jobs can be used instead.
.IP

.TP
\fBAND\fR
Only nodes with all of specified features will be used.
The ampersand is used for an AND operator.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel&gpu"\fR
.IP

.TP
\fBOR\fR
Only nodes with at least one of specified features will be used.
The vertical bar is used for an OR operator. If changeable features are not
requested, nodes in the allocation can have different features. For example,
\fBsalloc -N2 \-\-constraint="intel|amd"\fR can result in a job allocation
where one node has the intel feature and the other node has the amd feature.
However, if the expression contains a changeable feature, then all OR operators
are automatically treated as Matching OR so that all nodes in the job
allocation have the same set of features. For example,
\fBsalloc -N2 \-\-constraint="foo|bar&baz"\fR
The job is allocated two nodes where both nodes have foo, or bar and baz (one
or both nodes could have foo, bar, and baz). The helpers NodeFeatures plugin
will find the first set of node features that matches all nodes in the job
allocation; these features are set as active features on the node and passed to
RebootProgram (see \fBslurm.conf\fR(5)) and the helper script (see
\fBhelpers.conf\fR(5)). In this case, the helpers plugin uses the first of
"foo" or "bar,baz" that match the two nodes in the job allocation.
.IP

.TP
\fBMatching OR\fR
If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated
nodes, then use the OR operator and enclose the options within square brackets.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]"\fR might
be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a single rack of
the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.
.IP

.TP
\fBMultiple Counts\fR
Specific counts of multiple resources may be specified by using the AND
operator and enclosing the options within square brackets.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="[rack1*2&rack2*4]"\fR might
be used to specify that two nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature
of "rack1" and four nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature
"rack2".

\fBNOTE\fR: This construct does not support multiple Intel KNL NUMA or MCDRAM
modes. For example, while \fB\-\-constraint="[(knl&quad)*2&(knl&hemi)*4]"\fR is
not supported, \fB\-\-constraint="[haswell*2&(knl&hemi)*4]"\fR is supported.
Specification of multiple KNL modes requires the use of a heterogeneous job.

\fBNOTE\fR: This option is not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.

\fBNOTE\fR: Multiple Counts can cause jobs to be allocated with a non-optimal
network layout.
.IP

.TP
\fBBrackets\fR
Brackets can be used to indicate that you are looking for a set of nodes with
the different requirements contained within the brackets. For example,
\fB\-\-constraint="[(rack1|rack2)*1&(rack3)*2]"\fR will get you one node with
either the "rack1" or "rack2" features and two nodes with the "rack3" feature.
If requesting more than one feature and using node counts, the request
must have square brackets surrounding it.

\fBNOTE\fR: Brackets are only reserved for \fBMultiple Counts\fR and
\fBMatching OR\fR syntax.
AND operators require a count for each feature inside square brackets
(i.e. "[quad*2&hemi*1]"). Slurm will only allow a single set of bracketed
constraints per job.

\fBNOTE\fR: Square brackets are not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures
plugin. Matching OR can be requested without square brackets by using the
vertical bar character with at least one changeable feature.
.IP

.TP
\fBParentheses\fR
Parentheses can be used to group like node features together. For example,
\fB\-\-constraint="[(knl&snc4&flat)*4&haswell*1]"\fR might be used to specify
that four nodes with the features "knl", "snc4" and "flat" plus one node with
the feature "haswell" are required.
Parentheses can also be used to group operations. Without parentheses, node
features are parsed strictly from left to right.
For example,
\fB\-\-constraint="foo&bar|baz"\fR requests nodes with foo and bar, or baz.
\fB\-\-constraint="foo|bar&baz"\fR requests nodes with foo and baz, or bar and
baz (note how baz was AND'd with everything).
\fB\-\-constraint="foo&(bar|baz)"\fR requests nodes with foo and at least
one of bar or baz.
\fBNOTE\fR: OR within parentheses should not be used with a KNL
NodeFeatures plugin but is supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-\-container\fR=<\fIpath_to_container\fR>
Absolute path to OCI container bundle.

\fB\-\-container-id\fR=<\fIcontainer_id\fR>
Unique name for OCI container.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-contiguous\fR
If set, then the allocated nodes must form a contiguous set.

\fBNOTE\fR: If the SelectType is cons_tres this option won't be honored
with the \fBtopology/tree\fR or \fBtopology/3d_torus\fR
plugins, both of which can modify the node ordering.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-core\-spec\fR=<\fInum\fR>
Count of Specialized Cores per node reserved by the job for system operations
and not used by the application.
If AllowSpecResourcesUsage is enabled a job can override the CoreSpecCount of
all its allocated nodes with this option.
The overridden Specialized Cores will still be reserved for system processes.
The job will get an implicit \fB--exclusive\fR allocation for the rest of
the Cores on the nodes, resulting in the job's processes being able to use (and
being charged for) all the Cores on the nodes except for the overridden
Specialized Cores.
This option can not be used with the \fB\-\-thread\-spec\fR option.

\fBNOTE\fR: Explicitly setting a job's specialized core value implicitly sets
the --exclusive option.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-cores\-per\-socket\fR=<\fIcores\fR>
Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of
cores per socket.  See additional information under \fB\-B\fR option
above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if \fB\-n\fR
was not specified) as one task per requested thread.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-cpu\-freq\fR=<\fIp1\fR>[\-\fIp2\fR][:\fIp3\fR]

Request that job steps initiated by srun commands inside this sbatch script
be run at some requested frequency if possible, on the CPUs selected
for the step on the compute node(s).

\fBp1\fR can be  [#### | low | medium | high | highm1] which will set the
frequency scaling_speed to the corresponding value, and set the frequency
scaling_governor to UserSpace. See below for definition of the values.

\fBp1\fR can be [Conservative | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave] which
will set the scaling_governor to the corresponding value. The governor has to be
in the list set by the slurm.conf option CpuFreqGovernors.

When \fBp2\fR is present, \fBp1\fR will be the minimum scaling frequency and
\fBp2\fR will be the maximum scaling frequency. In that case the governor
\fBp3\fR or CpuFreqDef cannot be UserSpace since it doesn't support a range.

\fBp2\fR can be  [#### | medium | high | highm1]. p2 must be greater than p1 and
is incompatible with UserSpace governor.

\fBp3\fR can be [Conservative | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave | SchedUtil |
UserSpace]
which will set the governor to the corresponding value.

If \fBp3\fR is UserSpace, the frequency scaling_speed, scaling_max_freq and
scaling_min_freq will be statically set to the value defined by \fBp1\fR.

Any requested frequency below the minimum available frequency will be rounded
to the minimum available frequency. In the same way, any requested frequency
above the maximum available frequency will be rounded to the maximum available
frequency.

The \fBCpuFreqDef\fR parameter in slurm.conf will be used to set the governor
in absence of \fBp3\fR. If there's no \fBCpuFreqDef\fR, the default governor
will be to use the system current governor set in each cpu. Specifying a
range without \fBCpuFreqDef\fR or a specific governor is therefore not allowed.

The following informational environment variable is set in the job
step when \fB\-\-cpu\-freq\fR option is requested.
.nf
        SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ
.fi

This environment variable can also be used to supply the value for the
CPU frequency request if it is set when the 'srun' command is issued.
The \fB\-\-cpu\-freq\fR on the command line will override the
environment variable value.  The form on the environment variable is
the same as the command line.
See the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\fR
section for a description of the SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ variable.

\fBNOTE\fR: This parameter is treated as a request, not a requirement.
If the job step's node does not support setting the CPU frequency, or
the requested value is outside the bounds of the legal frequencies, an
error is logged, but the job step is allowed to continue.

\fBNOTE\fR: Setting the frequency for just the CPUs of the job step
implies that the tasks are confined to those CPUs.  If task
confinement (i.e. the task/affinity TaskPlugin is enabled, or the task/cgroup
TaskPlugin is enabled with "ConstrainCores=yes" set in cgroup.conf) is not
configured, this parameter is ignored.

\fBNOTE\fR: When the step completes, the frequency and governor of each
selected CPU is reset to the previous values.

\fBNOTE\fR: When submitting jobs with  the \fB\-\-cpu\-freq\fR option
with linuxproc as the ProctrackType can cause jobs to run too quickly before
Accounting is able to poll for job information. As a result not all of
accounting information will be present.

Advise the Slurm controller that ensuing job steps will require \fIncpus\fR
number of processors per task.  Without this option, the controller will
just try to allocate one processor per task.

For instance,
consider an application that has 4 tasks, each requiring 3 processors.  If our
cluster is comprised of quad\-processors nodes and we simply ask for
12 processors, the controller might give us only 3 nodes.  However, by using
the \-\-cpus\-per\-task=3 options, the controller knows that each task requires
3 processors on the same node, and the controller will grant an allocation
of 4 nodes, one for each of the 4 tasks.

<\fItype:job_id[:job_id][?type:job_id[:job_id]]\fR>.
All dependencies must be satisfied if the "," separator is used.
Any dependency may be satisfied if the "?" separator is used.
Only one separator may be used. For instance:
.nf
-d afterok:20:21,afterany:23
.fi
.IP
means that the job can run only after a 0 return code of jobs 20 and 21
AND the completion of job 23. However:
.nf
-d afterok:20:21?afterany:23
.fi
means that any of the conditions (afterok:20 OR afterok:21 OR afterany:23)
will be enough to release the job.
Many jobs can share the same dependency and these jobs may even belong to
different  users. The  value may be changed after job submission using the
scontrol command.
Dependencies on remote jobs are allowed in a federation.
Once a job dependency fails due to the termination state of a preceding job,
the dependent job will never be run, even if the preceding job is requeued and
has a different termination state in a subsequent execution.

Specify alternate distribution methods for remote processes.
For job allocation, this sets environment variables that will be used by
subsequent srun requests and also affects which cores will be selected for
job allocation.

This option controls the distribution of tasks to the nodes on which
resources have been allocated, and the distribution of those resources
to tasks for binding (task affinity). The first distribution
method (before the first ":") controls the distribution of tasks to nodes.
The second distribution method (after the first ":")
controls the distribution of allocated CPUs across sockets for binding
to tasks. The third distribution method (after the second ":") controls
the distribution of allocated CPUs across cores for binding to tasks.
The second and third distributions apply only if task affinity is enabled.
The third distribution is supported only if the task/cgroup plugin is
configured. The default value for each distribution type is specified by *.

Note that with select/cons_tres, the number of CPUs
allocated to each socket and node may be different. Refer to
https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html
for more information on resource allocation, distribution of tasks to
nodes, and binding of tasks to CPUs.
.RS
First distribution method (distribution of tasks across nodes):

.TP
.B *
Use the default method for distributing tasks to nodes (block).
.IP

.TP
.B block
The block distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such
that consecutive tasks share a node. For example, consider an
allocation of three nodes each with two cpus. A four\-task block
distribution request will distribute those tasks to the nodes with
tasks one and two on the first node, task three on the second node,
and task four on the third node.  Block distribution is the default
behavior if the number of tasks exceeds the number of allocated nodes.
.IP

.TP
.B cyclic
The cyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such
that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive nodes (in a
round\-robin fashion). For example, consider an allocation of three
nodes each with two cpus. A four\-task cyclic distribution request
will distribute those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and four on
the first node, task two on the second node, and task three on the
third node.
Note that when SelectType is select/cons_tres, the same number of CPUs
may not be allocated on each node. Task distribution will be
round\-robin among all the nodes with CPUs yet to be assigned to tasks.
Cyclic distribution is the default behavior if the number
of tasks is no larger than the number of allocated nodes.
.IP

.TP
.B plane
The tasks are distributed in blocks of size <\fIsize\fR>. The size must be given
or SLURM_DIST_PLANESIZE must be set. The number of tasks
distributed to each node is the same as for cyclic distribution, but the
taskids assigned to each node depend on the plane size. Additional distribution
specifications cannot be combined with this option.
For more details (including examples and diagrams), please see
https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html and
https://slurm.schedmd.com/dist_plane.html

.TP
.B arbitrary
The arbitrary method of distribution will allocate processes in\-order
as listed in file designated by the environment variable
SLURM_HOSTFILE. If this variable is listed it will override any
other method specified.  If not set the method will default to block.
Inside the hostfile must contain at minimum the number of hosts
requested and be one per line or comma separated.  If specifying a
task count (\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-ntasks\fR=<\fInumber\fR>), your tasks
will be laid out on the nodes in the order of the file.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: The arbitrary distribution option on a job allocation only
controls the nodes to be allocated to the job and not the allocation of
CPUs on those nodes. This option is meant primarily to control a job step's
task layout in an existing job allocation for the srun command.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: If the number of tasks is given and a list of requested nodes is
also given, the number of nodes used from that list will be reduced to match
that of the number of tasks if the number of nodes in the list is greater than
the number of tasks.

.B block
The block distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs
consecutively from the same socket for binding to tasks, before using

.B cyclic
The cyclic distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for
binding to a given task consecutively from the same socket, and
from the next consecutive socket for the next task, in a
round\-robin fashion across sockets.
Tasks requiring more than one CPU will have all of those CPUs allocated on a
single socket if possible.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: In nodes with hyper-threading enabled, a task not requesting full

\fB\-\-exclusive\fR[={user|mcs}]
The job allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs (or just other
users with the "=user" option or with the "=mcs" option).
If user/mcs are not specified (i.e. the job allocation can not share nodes with
other running jobs), the job is allocated all CPUs and GRES on all nodes in the
allocation, but is only allocated as much memory as it requested. This is by
design to support gang scheduling, because suspended jobs still reside in
memory. To request all the memory on a node, use \fB\-\-mem=0\fR.
The default shared/exclusive behavior depends on system configuration and the
partition's \fBOverSubscribe\fR option takes precedence over the job's option.
\fBNOTE\fR: Since shared GRES (MPS) cannot be allocated at the same time as a

\fB\-\-export\fR=NIL
Only SLURM_* and SPANK option variables from the user environment will be

Unlike NONE, NIL will not automatically create a user's environment using the

\fB\-\-export\fR=NONE
Only SLURM_* and SPANK option variables from the user environment will be

define the environment.
User can not specify explicit environment variables with "NONE".
However, Slurm will then implicitly attempt to load the user's environment on
the node where the script is being executed, as if \fI\-\-get\-user\-env\fR was
specified.

This option is particularly important for jobs that are submitted on one cluster
and execute on a different cluster (e.g. with different paths).
To avoid steps inheriting environment export settings (e.g. "NONE") from
sbatch command, the environment variable SLURM_EXPORT_ENV should be set to
"ALL" in the job script.

\fB\-\-mem\-bind\fR=[{quiet|verbose},]<\fItype\fR>
Bind tasks to memory. Used only when the task/affinity plugin is enabled
and the NUMA memory functions are available.
\fBNote that the resolution of CPU and memory binding
may differ on some architectures.\fR For example, CPU binding may be performed
at the level of the cores within a processor while memory binding will
be performed at the level of nodes, where the definition of "nodes"
may differ from system to system.
By default no memory binding is performed; any task using any CPU can use
any memory. This option is typically used to ensure that each task is bound to
the memory closest to its assigned CPU. \fBThe use of any type other than
"none" or "local" is not recommended.\fR

\fBNOTE\fR: To have Slurm always report on the selected memory binding for
all commands executed in a shell, you can enable verbose mode by
setting the SLURM_MEM_BIND environment variable value to "verbose".

The following informational environment variables are set when
\fB\-\-mem\-bind\fR is in use:

.B map_mem:<list>
Bind by setting memory masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is

The mapping is specified for a node and identical mapping is applied to the
tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each node is mapped to the
first ID specified in the list, etc.).
NUMA IDs are interpreted as decimal values unless they are preceded
with '0x' in which case they interpreted as hexadecimal values.
If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number of elements in this list,
elements in the list will be reused as needed starting from the beginning of
the list.
To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a map with an
asterisk and repetition count.
For example "map_mem:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".
For predictable binding results, all CPUs for each node in the job should be
allocated to the job.

NUMA masks are \fBalways\fR interpreted as hexadecimal values.
Note that masks must be preceded with a '0x' if they don't begin

\fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR=<\fIsize\fR>[\fIunits\fR]
Minimum memory required per usable allocated CPU.
Default units are megabytes.
The default value is \fBDefMemPerCPU\fR and the maximum value is
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR (see exception below). If configured, both parameters can be
seen using the \fBscontrol show config\fR command.
Note that if the job's \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR value exceeds the configured
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR, then the user's limit will be treated as a memory limit
per task; \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR will be reduced to a value no larger than
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR; \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR will be set and the value of
\fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR multiplied by the new \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR
value will equal the original \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR value specified by
the user.
This parameter would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs (\fBSelectType=select/cons_tres\fR).
If resources are allocated by core, socket, or whole nodes, then the number
of CPUs allocated to a job may be higher than the task count and the value
of \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR should be adjusted accordingly.
Also see \fB\-\-mem\fR and \fB\-\-mem\-per\-gpu\fR.
The \fB\-\-mem\fR, \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR and \fB\-\-mem\-per\-gpu\fR
options are mutually exclusive.

\fBNOTE\fR: If the final amount of memory requested by a job
can't be satisfied by any of the nodes configured in the
partition, the job will be rejected.
This could happen if \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR is used with the
\fB\-\-exclusive\fR option for a job allocation and \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR
times the number of CPUs on a node is greater than the total memory of that
node.

\fBNOTE\fR: This applies to \fBusable\fR allocated CPUs in a job allocation.
This is important when more than one thread per core is configured.
If a job requests \-\-threads\-per\-core with fewer threads on a core than
exist on the core (or \-\-hint=nomultithread which implies
\-\-threads\-per\-core=1), the job will be unable to use those extra threads on
the core and those threads will not be included in the memory per CPU
calculation. But if the job has access to all threads on the core, those threads
will be included in the memory per CPU calculation even if the job did not
explicitly request those threads.

In the following examples, each core has two threads.

In this first example, two tasks can run on separate hyperthreads
in the same core because \-\-threads\-per\-core is not used. The
third task uses both threads of the second core. The allocated
memory per cpu includes all threads:

.nf
.ft B

.ft
.fi

In this second example, because of \-\-threads\-per\-core=1, each
task is allocated an entire core but is only able to use one
thread per core. Allocated CPUs includes all threads on each
core. However, allocated memory per cpu includes only the
usable thread in each core.

PerfCnts.  These nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.
.RE

In all cases the job allocation request \fBmust specify the

Also with any of these options steps are not allowed to share blades,
so resources would remain idle inside an allocation if the step
running on a blade does not take up all the nodes on the blade.

The \fBnetwork\fR option is also available on systems with HPE Slingshot
networks. It can be used to request a job VNI (to be used for communication

The job allocation will not be revoked so the user may launch new
job steps on the remaining nodes in their allocation.
This option does not set the \fBSLURM_NO_KILL\fR environment variable.
Therefore, when a node fails, steps running on that node will be killed unless
the \fBSLURM_NO_KILL\fR environment variable was explicitly set or srun calls
within the job allocation explicitly requested \-\-no\-kill.

The list may be specified as a comma\-separated list of hosts, a range of hosts
(host[1\-5,7,...] for example), or a filename.
The host list will be assumed to be a filename if it contains a "/" character.
If you specify a minimum node or processor count larger than can be satisfied
by the supplied host list, additional resources will be allocated on other
nodes as needed.
Duplicate node names in the list will be ignored.
The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names

\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-nodes\fR=<\fIminnodes\fR>[\-\fImaxnodes\fR]|<\fIsize_string\fR>
Request that a minimum of \fIminnodes\fR nodes be allocated to this job.
A maximum node count may also be specified with \fImaxnodes\fR.
If only one number is specified, this is used as both the minimum and
maximum node count. Node count can be also specified as size_string.
The size_string specification identifies what nodes values should be used.
Multiple values may be specified using a comma separated list or
with a step function by suffix containing a colon and
number values with a "-" separator.
For example, "--nodes=1-15:4" is equivalent to "--nodes=1,5,9,13".
The partition's node limits supersede those of the job.
If a job's node limits are outside of the range permitted for its
associated partition, the job will be left in a PENDING state.
This permits possible execution at a later time, when the partition
limit is changed.
If a job node limit exceeds the number of nodes configured in the
partition, the job will be rejected.
Note that the environment
variable \fBSLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES\fR will be set to the count of nodes actually
allocated to the job. See the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES \fR section
for more information.  If \fB\-N\fR is not specified, the default
behavior is to allocate enough nodes to satisfy the requested resources as
expressed by per\-job specification options, e.g. \fB\-n\fR, \fB\-c\fR and
\fB--gpus\fR.
The job will be allocated as many nodes as possible within the range specified
and without delaying the initiation of the job.
The node count specification may include a numeric value followed by a suffix
of "k" (multiplies numeric value by 1,024) or "m" (multiplies numeric value by
1,048,576).

\fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-gpu\fR=<\fIntasks\fR>
Request that there are \fIntasks\fR tasks invoked for every GPU.
This option can work in two ways: 1) either specify \fB\-\-ntasks\fR in
addition, in which case a type\-less GPU specification will be automatically
determined to satisfy \fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-gpu\fR, or 2) specify the GPUs wanted
(e.g. via \fB\-\-gpus\fR or \fB\-\-gres\fR) without specifying \fB\-\-ntasks\fR,
and the total task count will be automatically determined.
The number of CPUs needed will be automatically increased if necessary to allow
for any calculated task count.
This option will implicitly set \fB\-\-tres\-bind=gres/gpu:single:<ntasks>\fR,
but that can be overridden with an explicit \fB\-\-tres\-bind=gres/gpu\fR
specification.
This option is not compatible with a node range

request that no more than a specific number of tasks be invoked
on each node.  Examples of this include submitting
a hybrid MPI/OpenMP app where only one MPI "task/rank" should be

\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-overcommit\fR
Overcommit resources.

When applied to a job allocation (not including jobs requesting exclusive
access to the nodes) the resources are allocated as if only one task per
node is requested. This means that the requested number of cpus per task
(\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR) are allocated per node rather than
being multiplied by the number of tasks. Options used to specify the number
of tasks per node, socket, core, etc. are ignored.

When applied to job step allocations (the \fBsrun\fR command when executed
within an existing job allocation), this option can be used to launch more than
one task per CPU.
Normally, \fBsrun\fR will not allocate more than one process per CPU.
By specifying \fB\-\-overcommit\fR you are explicitly allowing more than one
process per CPU. However no more than \fBMAX_TASKS_PER_NODE\fR tasks are
permitted to execute per node.  \fBNOTE\fR: \fBMAX_TASKS_PER_NODE\fR is

\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-oversubscribe\fR
The job allocation can over\-subscribe resources with other running jobs.
The resources to be over\-subscribed can be nodes, sockets, cores, and/or

The default over\-subscribe behavior depends on system configuration and the
partition's \fBOverSubscribe\fR option takes precedence over the job's option.
This option may result in the allocation being granted sooner than if the
\-\-oversubscribe option was not set and allow higher system utilization, but
application performance will likely suffer due to competition for resources.

.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-requeue\fR
Specifies that the batch job should be eligible for requeuing.
The job may be requeued explicitly by a system administrator, after node
failure, or upon preemption by a higher priority job.
When a job is requeued, the batch script is initiated from its beginning.
Also see the \fB\-\-no\-requeue\fR option.
The \fIJobRequeue\fR configuration parameter controls the default

\fB\-\-reservation\fR=<\fIreservation_names\fR>
Allocate resources for the job from the named reservation. If the job can use
more than one reservation, specify their names in a comma separate list and the
one offering earliest initiation. Each reservation will be considered in the
order it was requested.
All reservations will be listed in scontrol/squeue through the life of the job.
In accounting the first reservation will be seen and after the job starts the
reservation used will replace it.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-signal\fR=[{R|B}:]<\fIsig_num\fR>[@\fIsig_time\fR]
When a job is within \fIsig_time\fR seconds of its end time,
send it the signal \fIsig_num\fR.
Due to the resolution of event handling by Slurm, the signal may
be sent up to 60 seconds earlier than specified.
\fIsig_num\fR may either be a signal number or name (e.g. "10" or "USR1").
\fIsig_time\fR must have an integer value between 0 and 65535.
By default, no signal is sent before the job's end time.
If a \fIsig_num\fR is specified without any \fIsig_time\fR,
the default time will be 60 seconds.
Use the "B:" option to signal only the batch shell, none of the other
processes will be signaled. By default all job steps will be signaled,
but not the batch shell itself.
Use the "R:" option to allow this job to overlap with a reservation with
MaxStartDelay set.
To have the signal sent at preemption time see the \fBsend_user_signal\fR
\fBPreemptParameter\fR.
.IP

\fB\-\-sockets\-per\-node\fR=<\fIsockets\fR>
Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of

task/affinity plugin is enabled.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if \fB\-n\fR
was not specified) as one task per requested thread.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-spread\-job\fR
Spread the job allocation over as many nodes as possible and attempt to
evenly distribute tasks across the allocated nodes.
This option disables the topology/tree plugin.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-switches\fR=<\fIcount\fR>[@\fImax\-time\fR]
When a tree topology is used, this defines the maximum count of leaf switches
desired for the job allocation and optionally the maximum time to wait
for that number of switches. If Slurm finds an allocation containing more
switches than the count specified, the job remains pending until it either finds
an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires.
It there is no switch count limit, there is no delay in starting the job.
Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds",
"hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and
"days\-hours:minutes:seconds".
The job's maximum time delay may be limited by the system administrator using
the \fBSchedulerParameters\fR configuration parameter with the
\fBmax_switch_wait\fR parameter option.
On a dragonfly network the only switch count supported is 1 since communication
performance will be highest when a job is allocate resources on one leaf switch
or more than 2 leaf switches.
The default max\-time is the max_switch_wait SchedulerParameters.
.IP

\fB\-\-test\-only\fR
Validate the batch script and return an estimate of when a job would be
scheduled to run given the current job queue and all the other arguments
specifying the job requirements. No job is actually submitted.
.IP

\fB\-\-thread\-spec\fR=<\fInum\fR>
Count of specialized threads per node reserved by the job for system operations
and not used by the application. The application will not use these threads,
but will be charged for their allocation.
This option can not be used with the \fB\-\-core\-spec\fR option.

\fBNOTE\fR: Explicitly setting a job's specialized thread value implicitly sets
its --exclusive option, reserving entire nodes for the job.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-threads\-per\-core\fR=<\fIthreads\fR>
Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of
threads per core. In task layout, use the specified maximum number of threads
per core. \fBNOTE\fR: "Threads" refers to the number of processing units on
each core rather than the number of application tasks to be launched per core.
See additional information under \fB\-B\fR option above when task/affinity
plugin is enabled.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if \fB\-n\fR
was not specified) as one task per requested thread.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Set a limit on the total run time of the job allocation.  If the
requested time limit exceeds the partition's time limit, the job will
be left in a PENDING state (possibly indefinitely).  The default time
limit is the partition's default time limit.  When the time limit is reached,
each task in each job step is sent SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL.  The
interval between signals is specified by the Slurm configuration
parameter \fBKillWait\fR.  The \fBOverTimeLimit\fR configuration parameter may
permit the job to run longer than scheduled.  Time resolution is one minute
and second values are rounded up to the next minute.

A time limit of zero requests that no time limit be imposed.  Acceptable time
formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds",
"days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and "days\-hours:minutes:seconds".
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-time\-min\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Set a minimum time limit on the job allocation.
If specified, the job may have its \fB\-\-time\fR limit lowered to a value
no lower than \fB\-\-time\-min\fR if doing so permits the job to begin
execution earlier than otherwise possible.
The job's time limit will not be changed after the job is allocated resources.
This is performed by a backfill scheduling algorithm to allocate resources
otherwise reserved for higher priority jobs.
Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds",
"hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and
"days\-hours:minutes:seconds".
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-tmp\fR=<\fIsize\fR>[\fIunits\fR]

Default units are megabytes.
Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-tres\-bind\fR=<\fItres\fR>:[verbose,]<\fItype\fR>[+<\fItres\fR>:
[verbose,]<\fItype\fR>...]
Specify a list of tres with their task binding options. Currently gres are the
only supported tres for this options. Specify gres as "gres/<gres_name>"
(e.g. gres/gpu)

Example: \-\-tres\-bind=gres/gpu:verbose,map:0,1,2,3+gres/nic:closest

By default, most tres are not bound to individual tasks

Supported binding \fItype\fR options for \fBgres\fR:
.IP
.RS
.TP 10
\fBclosest\fR
Bind each task to the gres(s) which are closest.
In a NUMA environment, each task may be bound to more than one gres (i.e.
all gres in that NUMA environment).
.IP

.TP
\fBmap:<list>\fR
Bind by setting gres masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is
<gres_id_for_task_0>,<gres_id_for_task_1>,... gres IDs are interpreted as decimal
values. If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number of elements in this
list, elements in the list will be reused as needed starting from the beginning
of the list. To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a
map with an asterisk and repetition count. For example "map:0*4,1*4".
If the task/cgroup plugin is used and ConstrainDevices is set in cgroup.conf,
then the gres IDs are zero\-based indexes relative to the gress allocated to the
job (e.g. the first gres is 0, even if the global ID is 3). Otherwise, the gres
IDs are global IDs, and all gres on each node in the job should be allocated for
predictable binding results.
.IP

.TP
\fBmask:<list>\fR
Bind by setting gres masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is
<gres_mask_for_task_0>,<gres_mask_for_task_1>,... The mapping is specified for
a node and identical mapping is applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the
lowest task ID on each node is mapped to the first mask specified in the list,
etc.). gres masks are always interpreted as hexadecimal values but can be
preceded with an optional '0x'. To simplify support for large task counts, the
lists may follow a map with an asterisk and repetition count.
For example "mask:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".
If the task/cgroup plugin is used and ConstrainDevices is set in cgroup.conf,
then the gres IDs are zero\-based indexes relative to the gres allocated to the
job (e.g. the first gres is 0, even if the global ID is 3). Otherwise, the gres
IDs are global IDs, and all gres on each node in the job should be allocated for
predictable binding results.
.IP

.TP
\fBnone\fR
Do not bind tasks to this gres (turns off implicit binding from
\-\-tres\-per\-task and \-\-gpus\-per\-task).
.IP

.TP
\fBper_task:<gres_per_task>\fR
Each task will be bound to the number of gres specified in
\fI<gres_per_task>\fR. Tasks are preferentially assigned gres with affinity to
cores in their allocation like in \fIclosest\fR, though they will
take any gres if they are unavailable. If no affinity exists, the first task
will be assigned the first x number of gres on the node etc.
Shared gres will prefer to bind one sharing device per task if possible.
.IP

.TP
\fBsingle:<tasks_per_gres>\fR
Like \fIclosest\fR, except that each task can only be bound to a
single gres, even when it can be bound to multiple gres that are equally close.
The gres to bind to is determined by \fI<tasks_per_gres>\fR, where the
first \fI<tasks_per_gres>\fR tasks are bound to the first gres available, the
second \fI<tasks_per_gres>\fR tasks are bound to the second gres available, etc.
This is basically a block distribution of tasks onto available gres, where the
available gres are determined by the socket affinity of the task and the socket
affinity of the gres as specified in gres.conf's \fICores\fR parameter.
.IP

\fBNOTE\fR: Shared gres binding is currently limited to per_task or none
.RE
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-tres\-per\-task\fR=<\fIlist\fR>
Specifies a comma\-delimited list of trackable resources required for the job on
each task to be spawned in the job's resource allocation.
The format for each entry in the list is "trestype/[tresname:]count".
The \fItrestype\fR is the type of trackable resource requested (e.g. cpu, gres,
license, etc).
The \fItresname\fR is the name of the trackable resource, as can be seen with
\fIsacctmgr show tres\fR. This is required when it exists for tres types such
as gres, license, etc. (e.g. gpu, gpu:a100).
The \fIcount\fR is the number of those resources.
.br
The count can have a suffix of
.br
"k" or "K" (multiple of 1024),
.br
"m" or "M" (multiple of 1024 x 1024),
.br
"g" or "G" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024),
.br
"t" or "T" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024),
.br
"p" or "P" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024).

Executing \fBsbatch\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmctld\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsbatch\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
