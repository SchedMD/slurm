.SH "NAME"
sbatch \- Submit a batch script to SLURM.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
sbatch [\fIoptions\fP] \fIscript\fP [\fIargs\fP...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
sbatch submits a batch script to SLURM.  The batch script may be given to
sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified,
sbatch will read in a script from standard input. The batch script may contain
options preceded with "#SBATCH" before any executable commands in the script.

sbatch exits immediately after the script is successfully transferred to the
SLURM controller and assigned a SLURM job ID.  The batch script is not
necessarily granted resources immediately, it may sit in the queue of pending
jobs for some time before its required resources become available.

By default both standard output and standard error are directed to a file of
the name "slurm\-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced with the job allocation
number.

When the job allocation is finally granted for the batch script, SLURM
runs a single copy of the batch script on the first node in the set of
allocated nodes.

The following document describes the influence of various options on the
allocation of cpus to jobs and tasks.

.LP

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-array\fR=<\fIindexes\fR>
Submit a job array, multiple jobs to be executed with identical parameters.
The \fIindexes\fR specification identifies what array index values should
be used. Multiple values may be specified using a comma separated list and/or
a range of values with a "\-" separator. For example, "\-\-array=0\-15" or
"\-\-array=0,6,16\-32".
A step function can also be specified with a suffix containing a colon and
number. For example, "\-\-array=0\-15:4" is equivalent to "\-\-array=0,4,8,12".
The minimum index value is 0.
the maximum value is one less than the configuration parameter MaxArraySize.

.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-account\fR=<\fIaccount\fR>
Charge resources used by this job to specified account.
The \fIaccount\fR is an arbitrary string. The account name may
be changed after job submission using the \fBscontrol\fR
command.

.TP
\fB\-\-acctg\-freq\fR
Define the job accounting and profiling sampling intervals.
This can be used to override the \fIJobAcctGatherFrequency\fR parameter in SLURM's
configuration file, \fIslurm.conf\fR.
The supported format is as follows:
.RS
.TP 12
\fB\-\-acctg\-freq=\fR\fI<datatype>\fR\fB=\fR\fI<interval>\fR
where \fI<datatype>\fR=\fI<interval>\fR specifies the task sampling
interval for the jobacct_gather plugin or a
sampling interval for a profiling type by the
acct_gather_profile plugin. Multiple,
comma-separated \fI<datatype>\fR=\fI<interval>\fR intervals
may be specified. Supported datatypes are as follows:
.RS
.TP
\fBtask=\fI<interval>\fR
where \fI<interval>\fR is the task sampling interval in seconds
for the jobacct_gather plugins and for task
profiling by the acct_gather_profile plugin.
.TP
\fBenergy=\fI<interval>\fR
where \fI<interval>\fR is the sampling interval in seconds
for energy profiling using the acct_gather_energy plugin
.TP
\fBnetwork=\fI<interval>\fR
where \fI<interval>\fR is the sampling interval in seconds
for infiniband profiling using the acct_gather_infiniband
plugin.
.TP
\fBfilesystem=\fI<interval>\fR
where \fI<interval>\fR is the sampling interval in seconds
for filesystem profiling using the acct_gather_filesystem
plugin.
.TP
.RE
.RE
.br
The default value for the task sampling interval is 30.
The default value for all other intervals is 0.
An interval of 0 disables sampling of the specified type.
If the task sampling interval is 0, accounting
information is collected only at job termination (reducing SLURM
interference with the job).
.br
.br
Smaller (non\-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance,
but a value of 30 seconds is not likely to be noticeable for
applications having less than 10,000 tasks.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-B\fR \fB\-\-extra\-node\-info\fR=<\fIsockets\fR[:\fIcores\fR[:\fIthreads\fR]]>
Request a specific allocation of resources with details as to the
number and type of computational resources within a cluster:
number of sockets (or physical processors) per node,
cores per socket, and threads per core.
The total amount of resources being requested is the product of all of
the terms.
Each value specified is considered a minimum.
An asterisk (*) can be used as a placeholder indicating that all available
resources of that type are to be utilized.
As with nodes, the individual levels can also be specified in separate
options if desired:
.nf
    \fB\-\-sockets\-per\-node\fR=<\fIsockets\fR>
    \fB\-\-cores\-per\-socket\fR=<\fIcores\fR>
    \fB\-\-threads\-per\-core\fR=<\fIthreads\fR>
.fi
If task/affinity plugin is enabled, then specifying an allocation in this
manner also sets a default \fB\-\-cpu_bind\fR option of \fIthreads\fR
if the \fB\-B\fR option specifies a thread count, otherwise an option of
\fIcores\fR if a core count is specified, otherwise an option of \fIsockets\fR.
If SelectType is configured to select/cons_res, it must have a parameter of
CR_Core, CR_Core_Memory, CR_Socket, or CR_Socket_Memory for this option
to be honored.
This option is not supported on BlueGene systems (select/bluegene plugin
is configured).
If not specified, the scontrol show job will display 'ReqS:C:T=*:*:*'.

.TP
\fB\-\-begin\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Submit the batch script to the SLURM controller immediately, like normal, but
tell the controller to defer the allocation of the job until the specified time.

Time may be of the form \fIHH:MM:SS\fR to run a job at
a specific time of day (seconds are optional).
(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)
You may also specify \fImidnight\fR, \fInoon\fR, or
\fIteatime\fR (4pm) and you can have a time\-of\-day suffixed
with \fIAM\fR or \fIPM\fR for running in the morning or the evening.
You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying
a date of the form \fIMMDDYY\fR or \fIMM/DD/YY\fR
\fIYYYY\-MM\-DD\fR. Combine date and time using the following
format \fIYYYY\-MM\-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]\fR. You can also
give times like \fInow + count time\-units\fR, where the time\-units
can be \fIseconds\fR (default), \fIminutes\fR, \fIhours\fR,
\fIdays\fR, or \fIweeks\fR and you can tell SLURM to run
the job today with the keyword \fItoday\fR and to run the
job tomorrow with the keyword \fItomorrow\fR.
The value may be changed after job submission using the
\fBscontrol\fR command.
For example:
.nf
   \-\-begin=16:00
   \-\-begin=now+1hour
   \-\-begin=now+60           (seconds by default)
   \-\-begin=2010\-01\-20T12:34:00
.fi

.RS
.PP
Notes on date/time specifications:
 \- Although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is
allowed by the code, note that the poll time of the SLURM scheduler
is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of the job on the exact
second.  The job will be eligible to start on the next poll
following the specified time. The exact poll interval depends on the
SLURM scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default sched/builtin).
 \- If no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
 \- If a date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current
year is assumed, unless the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has
already passed for that year, in which case the next year is used.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-\-checkpoint\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Specifies the interval between creating checkpoints of the job step.
By default, the job step will have no checkpoints created.
Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds",
"hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and
"days\-hours:minutes:seconds".

.TP
\fB\-\-checkpoint\-dir\fR=<\fIdirectory\fR>
Specifies the directory into which the job or job step's checkpoint should
be written (used by the checkpoint/blcrm and checkpoint/xlch plugins only).
The default value is the current working directory.
Checkpoint files will be of the form "<job_id>.ckpt" for jobs
and "<job_id>.<step_id>.ckpt" for job steps.

.TP
\fB\-\-comment\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
An arbitrary comment enclosed in double quotes if using spaces or some
special characters.

.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint\fR=<\fIlist\fR>
Nodes can have \fBfeatures\fR assigned to them by the SLURM administrator.
Users can specify which of these \fBfeatures\fR are required by their job
using the constraint option.
Only nodes having features matching the job constraints will be used to
satisfy the request.
Multiple constraints may be specified with AND, OR, exclusive OR,
resource counts, etc.
Supported \fbconstraint\fR options include:
.PD 1
.RS
.TP
\fBSingle Name\fR
Only nodes which have the specified feature will be used.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel"\fR
.TP
\fBNode Count\fR
A request can specify the number of nodes needed with some feature
by appending an asterisk and count after the feature name.
For example "\fB\-\-nodes=16 \-\-constraint=graphics*4 ..."\fR
indicates that the job requires 16 nodes at that at least four of those
nodes must have the feature "graphics."
.TP
\fBAND\fR
If only nodes with all of specified features will be used.
The ampersand is used for an AND operator.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel&gpu"\fR
.TP
\fBOR\fR
If only nodes with at least one of specified features will be used.
The vertical bar is used for an OR operator.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel|amd"\fR
.TP
\fBExclusive OR\fR
If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated
nodes, then use the OR operator and enclose the options within square brackets.
For example: "\fB\-\-constraint=[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]"\fR might
be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a single rack of
the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.
.TP
\fBMultiple Counts\fR
Specific counts of multiple resources may be specified by using the AND
operator and enclosing the options within square brackets.
For example: "\fB\-\-constraint=[rack1*2&rack2*4]"\fR might
be used to specify that two nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature
of "rack1" and four nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature
"rack2".
.RE

.TP
\fB\-\-contiguous\fR
If set, then the allocated nodes must form a contiguous set.
Not honored with the \fBtopology/tree\fR or \fBtopology/3d_torus\fR
plugins, both of which can modify the node ordering.

.TP
\fB\-\-cores\-per\-socket\fR=<\fIcores\fR>
Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of
cores per socket.  See additional information under \fB\-B\fR option
above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.

.TP
\fB\-\-cpu_bind\fR=[{\fIquiet,verbose\fR},]\fItype\fR
Bind tasks to CPUs.
Used only when the task/affinity or task/cgroup plugin is enabled.
The configuration parameter \fBTaskPluginParam\fR may override these options.
For example, if \fBTaskPluginParam\fR is configured to bind to cores,
your job will not be able to bind tasks to sockets.
NOTE: To have SLURM always report on the selected CPU binding for all
commands executed in a shell, you can enable verbose mode by setting
the SLURM_CPU_BIND environment variable value to "verbose".

The following informational environment variables are set when \fB\-\-cpu_bind\fR
is in use:
.nf
        SLURM_CPU_BIND_VERBOSE
        SLURM_CPU_BIND_TYPE
        SLURM_CPU_BIND_LIST
.fi

See the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLE\fR section for a more detailed description
of the individual SLURM_CPU_BIND* variables.

When using \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR to run multithreaded tasks, be aware that
CPU binding is inherited from the parent of the process.  This means that
the multithreaded task should either specify or clear the CPU binding
itself to avoid having all threads of the multithreaded task use the same
mask/CPU as the parent.  Alternatively, fat masks (masks which specify more
than one allowed CPU) could be used for the tasks in order to provide
multiple CPUs for the multithreaded tasks.

By default, a job step has access to every CPU allocated to the job.
To ensure that distinct CPUs are allocated to each job step, use the
\fB\-\-exclusive\fR option.

If the job step allocation includes an allocation with a number of
sockets, cores, or threads equal to the number of tasks to be started
then the tasks will by default be bound to the appropriate resources.
Disable this mode of operation by explicitly setting "-\-cpu\-bind=none".

Note that a job step can be allocated different numbers of CPUs on each node
or be allocated CPUs not starting at location zero. Therefore one of the
options which automatically generate the task binding is recommended.
Explicitly specified masks or bindings are only honored when the job step
has been allocated every available CPU on the node.

Binding a task to a NUMA locality domain means to bind the task to the set of
CPUs that belong to the NUMA locality domain or "NUMA node".
If NUMA locality domain options are used on systems with no NUMA support, then
each socket is considered a locality domain.

Supported options include:
.PD 1
.RS
.TP
.B q[uiet]
Quietly bind before task runs (default)
.TP
.B v[erbose]
Verbosely report binding before task runs
.TP
.B no[ne]
Do not bind tasks to CPUs (default)
.TP
.B rank
Automatically bind by task rank.
Task zero is bound to socket (or core or thread) zero, etc.
Not supported unless the entire node is allocated to the job.
.TP
.B map_cpu:<list>
Bind by mapping CPU IDs to tasks as specified
where <list> is <cpuid1>,<cpuid2>,...<cpuidN>.
CPU IDs are interpreted as decimal values unless they are preceded
with '0x' in which case they are interpreted as hexadecimal values.
Not supported unless the entire node is allocated to the job.
.TP
.B mask_cpu:<list>
Bind by setting CPU masks on tasks as specified
where <list> is <mask1>,<mask2>,...<maskN>.
CPU masks are \fBalways\fR interpreted as hexadecimal values but can be
preceded with an optional '0x'. Not supported unless the entire node is
allocated to the job.
.TP
.B sockets
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to sockets.
Only the CPUs on the socket which have been allocated to the job will be used.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated sockets
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.
.TP
.B cores
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to cores.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated cores
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.
.TP
.B threads
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to threads.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated threads
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.
.TP
.B ldoms
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to NUMA locality domains.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated locality domains
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.
.TP
.B boards
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to boards.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated boards
this can result in sub\-optimal binding. This option is supported by the
task/cgroup plugin only.

\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR=<\fIncpus\fR>
Advise the SLURM controller that ensuing job steps will require \fIncpus\fR
number of processors per task.  Without this option, the controller will
just try to allocate one processor per task.

For instance,
consider an application that has 4 tasks, each requiring 3 processors.  If our
cluster is comprised of quad\-processors nodes and we simply ask for
12 processors, the controller might give us only 3 nodes.  However, by using
the \-\-cpus\-per\-task=3 options, the controller knows that each task requires
3 processors on the same node, and the controller will grant an allocation
of 4 nodes, one for each of the 4 tasks.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-error\fR=<\fIfilename pattern\fR>
Instruct SLURM to connect the batch script's standard error directly to the
file name specified in the "\fIfilename pattern\fR".
By default both standard output and standard error are directed to the same file.
For job arrays, the default file name is "slurm-%A_%a.out", "%A" is replaced
by the job ID and "%a" with the array index.
For other jobs, the default file name is "slurm-%j.out", where the "%j" is
replaced by the job ID.
See the \fB\-\-input\fR option for filename specification options.

.TP
\fB\-\-exclusive\fR
The job allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs.
This is the opposite of \-\-share, whichever option is seen last
on the command line will be used. The default shared/exclusive
behavior depends on system configuration and the partition's \fBShared\fR
option takes precedence over the job's option.

.TP
\fB\-\-export\fR=<\fIenvironment variables | ALL | NONE\fR>
Identify which environment variables are propagated to the batch job.
Multiple environment variable names should be comma separated.
Environment variable names may be specified to propagate the current
value of those variables (e.g. "\-\-export=EDITOR") or specific values
for the variables may be exported (e.g.. "\-\-export=EDITOR=/bin/vi").
This option particularly important for jobs that are submitted on one cluster
and execute on a different cluster (e.g. with different paths). By default all
environment variables are propagated. If the argument is \fINONE\fR or
specific environment variable names, then the \fB\-\-get\-user\-env\fR
option will implicitly be set to load other environment variables based upon
the user's configuration on the cluster which executes the job.

.TP
\fB\-\-export\-file\fR=<\fIfilename\fR | \fIfd\fR>
If a number between 3 and OPEN_MAX is specified as the argument to
this option, a readable file descriptor will be assumed (STDIN and
STDOUT are not supported as valid arguments).  Otherwise a filename is
assumed.  Export environment variables defined in <\fIfilename\fR> or
read from <\fIfd\fR> to the job's execution environment. The
content is one or more environment variable definitions of the form
NAME=value, each separated by a null character.  This allows the use
of special characters in environment definitions.

.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-nodefile\fR=<\fInode file\fR>
Much like \-\-nodelist, but the list is contained in a file of name
\fInode file\fR.  The node names of the list may also span multiple lines
in the file.    Duplicate node names in the file will be ignored.
The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names
will be sorted by SLURM.

.TP
\fB\-\-get\-user\-env\fR[=\fItimeout\fR][\fImode\fR]
This option will tell sbatch to retrieve the
login environment variables for the user specified in the \fB\-\-uid\fR option.
The environment variables are retrieved by running something of this sort
"su \- <username> \-c /usr/bin/env" and parsing the output.
Be aware that any environment variables already set in sbatch's environment
will take precedence over any environment variables in the user's
login environment. Clear any environment variables before calling sbatch
that you do not want propagated to the spawned program.
The optional \fItimeout\fR value is in seconds. Default value is 8 seconds.
The optional \fImode\fR value control the "su" options.
With a \fImode\fR value of "S", "su" is executed without the "\-" option.
With a \fImode\fR value of "L", "su" is executed with the "\-" option,
replicating the login environment.
If \fImode\fR not specified, the mode established at SLURM build time
is used.
Example of use include "\-\-get\-user\-env", "\-\-get\-user\-env=10"
"\-\-get\-user\-env=10L", and "\-\-get\-user\-env=S".
This option was originally created for use by Moab.

MPI jobs) on that node will almost certainly suffer a fatal error, but with
\-\-no\-kill, the job allocation will not be revoked so the user may launch
new job steps on the remaining nodes in their allocation.

By default SLURM terminates the entire job allocation if any node fails in its
range of allocated nodes.

Specify alternate distribution methods for remote processes.
In sbatch, this only sets environment variables that will be used by
subsequent srun requests.
This option controls the assignment of tasks to the nodes on which
resources have been allocated, and the distribution of those resources
to tasks for binding (task affinity). The first distribution
method (before the ":") controls the distribution of resources across
nodes. The optional second distribution method (after the ":")
controls the distribution of resources across sockets within a node.
Note that with select/cons_res, the number of cpus allocated on each
socket and node may be different. Refer to
http://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html
for more information on resource allocation, assignment of tasks to
nodes, and binding of tasks to CPUs.
.RS

First distribution method:
.TP
.B block
The block distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such
that consecutive tasks share a node. For example, consider an
allocation of three nodes each with two cpus. A four\-task block
distribution request will distribute those tasks to the nodes with
tasks one and two on the first node, task three on the second node,
and task four on the third node.  Block distribution is the default
behavior if the number of tasks exceeds the number of allocated nodes.

.B cyclic
The cyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such
that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive nodes (in a
round\-robin fashion). For example, consider an allocation of three
nodes each with two cpus. A four\-task cyclic distribution request
will distribute those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and four on
the first node, task two on the second node, and task three on the
third node.
Note that when SelectType is select/cons_res, the same number of CPUs
may not be allocated on each node. Task distribution will be
round\-robin among all the nodes with CPUs yet to be assigned to tasks.
Cyclic distribution is the default behavior if the number
of tasks is no larger than the number of allocated nodes.
.TP
.B plane
The tasks are distributed in blocks of a specified size.  The options
include a number representing the size of the task block.  This is
followed by an optional specification of the task distribution scheme
within a block of tasks and between the blocks of tasks.  The number of tasks
distributed to each node is the same as for cyclic distribution, but the
taskids assigned to each node depend on the plane size.  For more
details (including examples and diagrams), please see

.TP
.B arbitrary
The arbitrary method of distribution will allocate processes in\-order
as listed in file designated by the environment variable
SLURM_HOSTFILE.  If this variable is listed it will override any
other method specified.  If not set the method will default to block.
Inside the hostfile must contain at minimum the number of hosts
requested and be one per line or comma separated.  If specifying a
task count (\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-ntasks\fR=<\fInumber\fR>), your tasks
will be laid out on the nodes in the order of the file.
.br
\fBNOTE:\fR The arbitrary distribution option on a job allocation only
controls the nodes to be allocated to the job and not the allocation of
CPUs on those nodes. This option is meant primarily to control a job step's
task layout in an existing job allocation for the srun command.

.TP
Second distribution method:
.TP
.B block
The block distribution method will distribute tasks to sockets such
that consecutive tasks share a socket.
.TP
.B cyclic
The cyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to sockets such
that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive sockets (in a
round\-robin fashion).

Specify the real memory required per node in MegaBytes.
Default value is \fBDefMemPerNode\fR and the maximum value is
\fBMaxMemPerNode\fR. If configured, both of parameters can be
seen using the \fBscontrol show config\fR command.
This parameter would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs (\fBSelectType=select/linear\fR).
Also see \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR.
\fB\-\-mem\fR and \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR are mutually exclusive.
NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently relies upon the task/cgroup plugin
or enabling of accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data
need not be stored, just collected). In both cases memory use is based upon
the job's Resident Set Size (RSS). A task may exceed the memory limit until
the next periodic accounting sample.

seen using the \fBscontrol show config\fR command.
Note that if the job's \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR value exceeds the configured
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR, then the user's limit will be treated as a memory limit
per task; \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR will be reduced to a value no larger than

\fB\-\-mem_bind\fR=[{\fIquiet,verbose\fR},]\fItype\fR
Bind tasks to memory. Used only when the task/affinity plugin is enabled
and the NUMA memory functions are available.
\fBNote that the resolution of CPU and memory binding
may differ on some architectures.\fR For example, CPU binding may be performed
at the level of the cores within a processor while memory binding will
be performed at the level of nodes, where the definition of "nodes"
may differ from system to system. \fBThe use of any type other than
"none" or "local" is not recommended.\fR
If you want greater control, try running a simple test code with the
options "\-\-cpu_bind=verbose,none \-\-mem_bind=verbose,none" to determine
the specific configuration.

NOTE: To have SLURM always report on the selected memory binding for
all commands executed in a shell, you can enable verbose mode by
setting the SLURM_MEM_BIND environment variable value to "verbose".

The following informational environment variables are set when
\fB\-\-mem_bind\fR is in use:

\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-nodes\fR=<\fIminnodes\fR[\-\fImaxnodes\fR]>
Request that a minimum of \fIminnodes\fR nodes be allocated to this job.
A maximum node count may also be specified with \fImaxnodes\fR.
If only one number is specified, this is used as both the minimum and
maximum node count.
The partition's node limits supersede those of the job.
If a job's node limits are outside of the range permitted for its
associated partition, the job will be left in a PENDING state.
This permits possible execution at a later time, when the partition
limit is changed.
If a job node limit exceeds the number of nodes configured in the
partition, the job will be rejected.
Note that the environment
variable \fBSLURM_NNODES\fR will be set to the count of nodes actually
allocated to the job. See the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES \fR section
for more information.  If \fB\-N\fR is not specified, the default
behavior is to allocate enough nodes to satisfy the requirements of
the \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-c\fR options.
The job will be allocated as many nodes as possible within the range specified
and without delaying the initiation of the job.
The node count specification may include a numeric value followed by a suffix
of "k" (multiplies numeric value by 1,024) or "m" (multiplies numeric value by
1,048,576).

\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-ntasks\fR=<\fInumber\fR>
sbatch does not launch tasks, it requests an allocation of resources and

Meant to be used with the \fB\-\-nodes\fR option.
This is related to \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR=\fIncpus\fR,
but does not require knowledge of the actual number of cpus on
each node.  In some cases, it is more convenient to be able to
request that no more than a specific number of tasks be invoked
on each node.  Examples of this include submitting
a hybrid MPI/OpenMP app where only one MPI "task/rank" should be
assigned to each node while allowing the OpenMP portion to utilize
all of the parallelism present in the node, or submitting a single
setup/cleanup/monitoring job to each node of a pre\-existing

Due to the resolution of event handling by SLURM, the signal may
be sent up to 60 seconds earlier than specified.
\fIsig_num\fR may either be a signal number or name (e.g. "10" or "USR1").
\fIsig_time\fR must have integer value between zero and 65535.
By default, no signal is sent before the job's end time.
If a \fIsig_num\fR is specified without any \fIsig_time\fR,

\fB\-\-switches\fR=<\fIcount\fR>[@<\fImax\-time\fR>]
When a tree topology is used, this defines the maximum count of switches
desired for the job allocation and optionally the maximum time to wait
for that number of switches. If SLURM finds an allocation containing more
switches than the count specified, the job remains pending until it either finds
an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires.
It there is no switch count limit, there is no delay in starting the job.
Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds",
"hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and
"days\-hours:minutes:seconds".
The job's maximum time delay may be limited by the system administrator using

limit is the partition's default time limit.  When the time limit is reached,
each task in each job step is sent SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL.  The
interval between signals is specified by the SLURM configuration
parameter \fBKillWait\fR.  A time limit of zero requests that no time
limit be imposed.  Acceptable time formats include "minutes",

If running on a BGP system and wanting to run in HTC mode (only for 1
midplane and below).  You can use HTC_S for SMP, HTC_D for Dual, HTC_V
for virtual node mode, and HTC_L for Linux mode.
For systems that allow a different connection type per dimension you
can supply a comma separated list of connection types may be specified, one for
each dimension (i.e. M,T,T,T will give you a torus connection is all
dimensions expect the first).

Specify the geometry requirements for the job. On BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P
systems there are three numbers giving dimensions in the X, Y and Z directions,
while on BlueGene/Q systems there are four numbers giving dimensions in the
A, X, Y and Z directions and can not be used to allocate sub-blocks.
For example "\-\-geometry=1x2x3x4", specifies a block of nodes having
1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 nodes (actually midplanes on BlueGene).
