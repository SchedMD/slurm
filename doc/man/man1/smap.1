.TH smap "1" "Slurm Commands" "March 2018" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
smap \- graphically view information about Slurm jobs, partitions, and set
configurations parameters.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsmap\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsmap\fR is used to graphically view job, partition and node information
for a system running Slurm.
Note that information about nodes and partitions to which you lack
access will always be displayed to avoid obvious gaps in the output.
This is equivalent to the \fB\-\-all\fR option of the \fBsinfo\fR and
\fBsqueue\fR commands.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-commandline\fR
Print output to the commandline, no curses.

.TP
\fB\-D <option>\fR, \fB\-\-display=<option>\fR
sets the display mode for smap, showing relevant information about the
selected view and displaying a corresponding node chart.  Note that
unallocated nodes are indicated by a '.' and nodes in the DOWN,
DRAINED or FAIL state by a '#'.  When the \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
option is also selected, you can switch displays by typing a different
letter from the list below.
.RS
.TP
.I "j"
Displays information about jobs running on system.
.TP
.I "r"
Display information about advanced reservations.
While all current and future reservations will be listed,
only currently active reservations will appear on the node map.
.TP
.I "s"
Displays information about slurm partitions on the system
.RE

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.

.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-show_hidden\fR
Display hidden partitions and their jobs.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR,
Print a message describing all \fBsmap\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-i <seconds>\fR , \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
Print the state on a periodic basis.
Sleep for the indicated number of seconds between reports.
User can exit at anytime by typing 'q' or hitting the return key.
If user is in configure mode type 'exit' to exit program, 'quit'
to exit configure mode.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nodes\fR
Only show objects with these nodes.

.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Avoid printing error messages.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief message listing the \fBsmap\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH "INTERACTIVE OPTIONS"
When using smap in curses mode and when the \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
option is also selected, you can scroll through the different windows
using the arrow keys.  The \fBup\fR and \fBdown\fR arrow keys scroll
the window containing the grid, and the \fBleft\fR and \fBright\fR arrow keys
scroll the window containing the text information.

With the iterate option selected, you can use any of the options
available to the \fB\-D\fR option listed above (except 'c') to change
screens.  You can also hide or make visible hidden partitions by
pressing 'h' at any moment.

.SH "OUTPUT FIELD DESCRIPTIONS"
.TP
\fBACCESS_CONTROL\fR
Identifies the users or bank accounts which can use this advanced reservation.
A prefix of "A:" indicates that the following account names may use this reservation.
A prefix of "U:" indicates that the following user names may use this reservation.
.TP
\fBAVAIL\fR
Partition state: \fBup\fR or \fBdown\fR.
.TP
\fBEND_TIME\fR

Names of nodes associated with this configuration, partition or reservation.
.TP
\fBNODES\fR
Count of nodes with this particular configuration.
.TP
\fBPARTITION\fR
Name of a partition.  Note that the suffix "*" identifies the
default partition.
.TP
\fBST\fR
State of a job in compact form. Possible states include:
PD (pending), R (running), S (suspended),
CD  (completed), CF (configuring), CG (completing),
F (failed), TO (timeout), and NF (node failure). See
\fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for more information.
.TP
\fBSTART_TIME\fR

Note that the suffix "*" identifies nodes that are presently
not responding.
See \fBNODE STATE CODES\fR section below for more information.
.TP
\fBTIMELIMIT\fR
Maximum time limit for any user job in
days\-hours:minutes:seconds.  \fBinfinite\fR is used to identify
jobs or partitions without a job time limit.
.TP

.SH "TOPOGRAPHY INFORMATION"
.PP
The node chart is designed to indicate relative locations of
the nodes.
On most Linux clusters this will represent a one\-dimensional
array of nodes. Larger clusters will utilize multiple as needed
with right side of one line being logically followed by the
left side of the next line.

.SH "NODE STATE CODES"
.PP
Node state codes are shortened as required for the field size.
These node states may be followed by a special character to identify
state flags associated with the node.
The following node sufficies and states are used:
.TP 4
\fB*\fR
The node is presently not responding and will not be allocated
any new work.  If the node remains non\-responsive, it will
be placed in the \fBDOWN\fR state (except in the case of
\fBCOMPLETING\fR, \fBDRAINED\fR, \fBDRAINING\fR,
\fBFAIL\fR, \fBFAILING\fR nodes).
.TP
\fB~\fR
The node is presently in a power saving mode (typically
running at reduced frequency).
.TP
\fB#\fR
The node is presently being powered up or configured.
.TP
\fB$\fR
The node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance".
.TP
\fB@\fR
The node is pending reboot.
.TP 12
\fBALLOCATED\fR
The node has been allocated to one or more jobs.
.TP
\fBALLOCATED+\fR
The node is allocated to one or more active jobs plus
one or more jobs are in the process of COMPLETING.
.TP
\fBCOMPLETING\fR
All jobs associated with this node are in the process of
COMPLETING.  This node state will be removed when
all of the job's processes have terminated and the Slurm
epilog program (if any) has terminated. See the \fBEpilog\fR
parameter description in the \fBslurm.conf\fR man page for
more information.
.TP
\fBDOWN\fR
The node is unavailable for use. Slurm can automatically
place nodes in this state if some failure occurs. System
administrators may also explicitly place nodes in this state. If
a node resumes normal operation, Slurm can automatically
return it to service. See the \fBReturnToService\fR
and \fBSlurmdTimeout\fR parameter descriptions in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
\fBDRAINED\fR
The node is unavailable for use per system administrator
request.  See the \fBupdate node\fR command in the
\fBscontrol\fR(1) man page or the \fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page
for more information.
.TP
\fBDRAINING\fR
The node is currently executing a job, but will not be allocated
to additional jobs. The node state will be changed to state
\fBDRAINED\fR when the last job on it completes. Nodes enter
this state per system administrator request. See the \fBupdate
node\fR command in the \fBscontrol\fR(1) man page or the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
\fBFAIL\fR
The node is expected to fail soon and is unavailable for
use per system administrator request.
See the \fBupdate node\fR command in the \fBscontrol\fR(1)
man page or the \fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
\fBFAILING\fR
The node is currently executing a job, but is expected to fail
soon and is unavailable for use per system administrator request.
See the \fBupdate node\fR command in the \fBscontrol\fR(1)
man page or the \fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
\fBIDLE\fR
The node is not allocated to any jobs and is available for use.
.TP
\fBMAINT\fR
The node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintainence".
.TP
\fBREBOOT\fR
The node is currently scheduled to be rebooted.
.TP
\fBUNKNOWN\fR
The Slurm controller has just started and the node's state
has not yet been determined.

.SH "JOB STATE CODES"
Jobs typically pass through several states in the course of their
execution.
The typical states are \fBPENDING\fR, \fBRUNNING\fR, \fBSUSPENDED\fR,
\fBCOMPLETING\fR, and \fBCOMPLETED\fR.
An explanation of each state follows.

\fBCA  CANCELLED\fR
Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator.
The job may or may not have been initiated.
.TP
\fBCD  COMPLETED\fR
Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with an exit code of zero.
.TP
\fBCG  COMPLETING\fR
Job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some nodes may still be active.
.TP
\fBCF  CONFIGURING\fR
Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use
(e.g. booting).
.TP
\fBF   FAILED\fR
Job terminated with non\-zero exit code or other failure condition.
.TP
\fBNF  NODE_FAIL\fR
Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.
.TP
\fBPD  PENDING\fR
Sibling job (in federation) revoked.

users, typically in EpilogSlurmctld, if the job has terminated with
a particular exit value.

Job has an allocation, but execution has been stopped with SIGSTOP signal.
CPUS have been retained by this job.
