.SH "NAME"
smap \- graphically view information about Slurm jobs, partitions, and set
configurations parameters.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsmap\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsmap\fR is used to graphically view job, partition and node information
for a system running Slurm.
Note that information about nodes and partitions to which you lack
access will always be displayed to avoid obvious gaps in the output.
This is equivalent to the \fB\-\-all\fR option of the \fBsinfo\fR and
\fBsqueue\fR commands.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-commandline\fR
Print output to the commandline, no curses.

.TP
\fB\-D <option>\fR, \fB\-\-display=<option>\fR
sets the display mode for smap, showing relevant information about the
selected view and displaying a corresponding node chart.  Note that
unallocated nodes are indicated by a '.' and nodes in the DOWN,
DRAINED or FAIL state by a '#'.  When the \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
option is also selected, you can switch displays by typing a different
letter from the list below (except 'c').
.RS
.TP 15
.I "b"
Displays information about BlueGene partitions on the system
.TP

.SH "TOPOGRAPHY INFORMATION"
.PP
The node chart is designed to indicate relative locations of
the nodes.
On most Linux clusters this will represent a one\-dimensional
array of nodes. Larger clusters will utilize multiple as needed
with right side of one line being logically followed by the
left side of the next line.
.PP
.nf
On BlueGene systems, the node chart will indicate the three
dimensional topography of the system.
The X dimension will increase from left to right on a given line.
The Y dimension will increase in planes from bottom to top.
The Z dimension will increase within a plane from the back
line to the front line of a plane.

.TP
\fBload <bluegene.conf file>\fR
Load an already existent bluegene.conf file. This will verify and mapout a
bluegene.conf file.  After loaded the configuration may be edited and
saved as a new file.

.TP
\fBcreate <size> <options>\fR
Submit request for partition creation. The size may be specified either
as a count of base partitions or specific dimensions in the X, Y and Z
directions separated by "x", for example "2x3x4". A variety of options
may be specified. Valid options are listed below. Note that the option
and their values are case insensitive (e.g. "MESH" and "mesh" are equivalent).
.TP
\fBStart = XxYxZ\fR
Identify where to start the partition.  This is primarily for testing
purposes.  For convenience one can only put the X coord or XxY will also work.
The default value is 0x0x0.
.TP
\fBConnection = MESH | TORUS | SMALL\fR
Identify how the nodes should be connected in network.
The default value is TORUS.
.RS
.TP
\fBSmall\fR

If a small connection is specified the base partition chosen will create
smaller partitions based on options \fB32CNBlocks\fR and
\fB128CNBlocks\fR respectively for a Bluegene L system.
\fB16CNBlocks\fR, \fB64CNBlocks\fR, and \fB256CNBlocks\fR are also
available for Bluegene P systems.  Keep in mind you
must have enough ionodes to make all these configurations possible.
  These number will be altered to take up the
entire base partition. Size does not need to be specified with a small
request, we will always default to 1 base partition for allocation.
.TP
\fBMesh\fR

.SH "NODE STATE CODES"
.PP
Node state codes are shortened as required for the field size.
These node states may be followed by a special character to identify
state flags associated with the node.
The following node sufficies and states are used:
.TP 4
\fB*\fR
The node is presently not responding and will not be allocated
any new work.  If the node remains non\-responsive, it will
be placed in the \fBDOWN\fR state (except in the case of
\fBCOMPLETING\fR, \fBDRAINED\fR, \fBDRAINING\fR,
\fBFAIL\fR, \fBFAILING\fR nodes).
.TP
\fB~\fR

COMPLETING.  This node state will be removed when
all of the job's processes have terminated and the Slurm
epilog program (if any) has terminated. See the \fBEpilog\fR
parameter description in the \fBslurm.conf\fR man page for
more information.
.TP
\fBDOWN\fR
The node is unavailable for use. Slurm can automatically
place nodes in this state if some failure occurs. System
administrators may also explicitly place nodes in this state. If
a node resumes normal operation, Slurm can automatically
return it to service. See the \fBReturnToService\fR
and \fBSlurmdTimeout\fR parameter descriptions in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.

for more information.
.TP
\fBDRAINING\fR
The node is currently executing a job, but will not be allocated
to additional jobs. The node state will be changed to state
\fBDRAINED\fR when the last job on it completes. Nodes enter
this state per system administrator request. See the \fBupdate
node\fR command in the \fBscontrol\fR(1) man page or the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
\fBFAIL\fR
The node is expected to fail soon and is unavailable for
use per system administrator request.
See the \fBupdate node\fR command in the \fBscontrol\fR(1)
man page or the \fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
