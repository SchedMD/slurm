.TH squeue "1" "Slurm Commands" "April 2019" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
squeue \- view information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsqueue\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsqueue\fR is used to view job and job step information for jobs managed by
Slurm.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-A <account_list>\fR, \fB\-\-account=<account_list>\fR
Specify the accounts of the jobs to view. Accepts a comma separated
list of account names. This has no effect when listing job steps.

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Display information about jobs and job steps in all partitions.
This causes information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as
hidden and partitions that are unavailable to user's group.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-array\fR
Display one job array element per line.
Without this option, the display will be optimized for use with job arrays
(pending job array elements will be combined on one line of output with the
array index values printed using a regular expression).

.TP
\fB\-\-array-unique\fR
Display one unique pending job array element per line. Without this option,
the pending job array elements will be grouped into the master array job to
optimize the display.  This can also be set with the environment variable
SQUEUE_ARRAY_UNIQUE.

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Show jobs from the federation if a member of one.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all options \fBsqueue\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-hide\fR
Do not display information about jobs and job steps in all partitions. By default,
information about partitions that are configured as hidden or are not available
to the user's group will not be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).

.TP
\fB\-i <seconds>\fR, \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
Repeatedly gather and report the requested information at the interval
specified (in seconds).
By default, prints a time stamp with the header.

.TP
\fB\-j <job_id_list>\fR, \fB\-\-jobs=<job_id_list>\fR
Requests a comma separated list of job IDs to display.  Defaults to all jobs.
The \fB\-\-jobs=<job_id_list>\fR option may be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-steps\fR option to print step information about specific jobs.
Note: If a list of job IDs is provided, the jobs are displayed even if
they are on hidden partitions. Since this option's argument is optional,
for proper parsing the single letter option must be followed immediately
with the value and not include a space between them. For example "\-j1008"
and not "\-j 1008".
The job ID format is "job_id[_array_id]".
Performance of the command can be measurably improved for systems with large
numbers of jobs when a single job ID is specified.
By default, this field size will be limited to 64 bytes.
Use the environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.


.TP
\fB\-\-local\fR
Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation
(if any). Overrides \-\-federation.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Report more of the available information for the selected jobs or job steps,
subject to any constraints specified.

.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-licenses=<license_list>\fR
Request jobs requesting or using one or more of the named licenses.
The license list consists of a comma separated list of license names.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to.  Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.
A value of of '\fIall\fR' will query to run on all clusters.
This option implicitly sets the \fB\-\-local\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name=<name_list>\fR
Request jobs or job steps having one of the specified names.  The
list consists of a comma separated list of job names.

.TP
\fB\-\-noconvert\fR
Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to
2G).

.TP
\fB\-o <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<output_format>\fR
Specify the information to be displayed, its size and position
(right or left justified).
Also see the \fB\-O <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-Format=<output_format>\fR
option described below (which supports less flexibility in formatting, but
supports access to all fields).
The default formats with various options are

.RS
.TP 15
\fIdefault\fR
"%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %R"
.TP
\fI\-l, \-\-long\fR

.RE

.IP
The format of each field is "%[[.]size]type".
.RS
.TP 8
\fIsize\fR
is the minimum field size.
If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be used.
.TP
\fI .\fR
indicates the output should be right justified and size must be specified.
By default, output is left justified.

.TP
\fB\-p <part_list>\fR, \fB\-\-partition=<part_list>\fR
Specify the partitions of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma separated
list of partition names.

.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-priority\fR
For pending jobs submitted to multiple partitions, list the job once per
partition. In addition, if jobs are sorted by priority, consider both the
partition and job priority. This option can be used to produce a list of
pending jobs in the same order considered for scheduling by Slurm with
appropriate additional options (e.g. "\-\-sort=\-p,i \-\-states=PD").

.TP
\fB\-q <qos_list>\fR, \fB\-\-qos=<qos_list>\fR
Specify the qos(s) of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma
separated list of qos's.

.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-reservation\fR=\fIreservation_name\fR
Specify the reservation of the jobs to view.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-steps\fR
Specify the job steps to view.  This flag indicates that a comma separated list
of job steps to view follows without an equal sign (see examples).
The job step format is "job_id[_array_id].step_id". Defaults to all job
steps. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing
the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value
and not include a space between them. For example "\-s1008.0" and not
"\-s 1008.0".

.TP
\fB\-\-sibling\fR
Show all sibling jobs on a federated cluster. Implies \-\-federation.

.TP
\fB\-S <sort_list>\fR, \fB\-\-sort=<sort_list>\fR
Specification of the order in which records should be reported.
This uses the same field specification as the <output_format>.
The long format option "cluster" can also be used to sort jobs or job steps by
cluster name (e.g. federated jobs).
Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields
separated by commas.
The field specifications may be preceded by "+" or "\-" for
ascending (default) and descending order respectively.
For example, a sort value of "P,U" will sort the
records by partition name then by user id.
The default value of sort for jobs is "P,t,\-p" (increasing partition
name then within a given partition by increasing job state and then
decreasing priority).
The default value of sort for job steps is "P,i" (increasing partition
name then within a given partition by increasing step id).

.TP
\fB\-\-start\fR
Report the expected start time and resources to be allocated for pending jobs
in order of increasing start time.
This is equivalent to the following options:
\fB\-\-format="%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t  %.19S %.6D %20Y %R"\fR,
\fB\-\-sort=S\fR and \fB\-\-states=PENDING\fR.
Any of these options may be explicitly changed as desired by
combining the \fB\-\-start\fR option with other option values
(e.g. to use a different output format).
The expected start time of pending jobs is only available if the
Slurm is configured to use the backfill scheduling plugin.

.TP
\fB\-t <state_list>\fR, \fB\-\-states=<state_list>\fR
Specify the states of jobs to view.  Accepts a comma separated list of
state names or "all". If "all" is specified then jobs of all states will be
reported. If no state is specified then pending, running, and completing
jobs are reported. See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for a list of
valid states. Both extended and compact forms are valid.
Note the \fB<state_list>\fR supplied is case insensitive ("pd" and "PD" are
equivalent).

.TP
\fB\-u <user_list>\fR, \fB\-\-user=<user_list>\fR
Request jobs or job steps from a comma separated list of users.
The list can consist of user names or user id numbers.
Performance of the command can be measurably improved for systems with large
numbers of jobs when a single user is specified.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief help message listing the \fBsqueue\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report details of squeues actions.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.TP
\fB\-w <hostlist>\fR, \fB\-\-nodelist=<hostlist>\fR
Report only on jobs allocated to the specified node or list of nodes.
This may either be the \fBNodeName\fR or \fBNodeHostname\fR
as defined in \fBslurm.conf(5)\fR in the event that they differ.
A node_name of \fBlocalhost\fR is mapped to the current host name.
