.SH "NAME"
squeue \- view information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsqueue\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsqueue\fR is used to view job and job step information for jobs managed by
Slurm.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-account\fR=<\fIaccount_list\fR>
Specify the accounts of the jobs to view. Accepts a comma separated
list of account names. This has no effect when listing job steps.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Display information about jobs and job steps in all partitions.
This causes information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as
hidden, partitions that are unavailable to a user's group, and federated jobs
that are in a "revoked" state.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-array\fR
Display one job array element per line.
Without this option, the display will be optimized for use with job arrays
(pending job array elements will be combined on one line of output with the
array index values printed using a regular expression).
.IP

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIcluster_name\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to. Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.
A value of '\fIall\fR' will query to run on all clusters.
Note that the \fBslurmdbd\fR must be up for this option to work properly, unless
running in a federation with either \fBFederationParameters=fed_display\fR
configured or the \fB\-\-federation\fR option set.
This option implicitly sets the \fB\-\-local\fR option.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-expand\-patterns\fR
Expand any filename patterns from in \f3StdOut\fP, \f3StdErr\fP and \f3StdIn\fP.
Fields that map to a range of values will use the first value of the range. For
example "%t" for task id will be replaced by "0".
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Show jobs from the federation if a member of one.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR=<\fIoutput_format\fR>
Specify the information to be displayed, its size and position
(right or left justified).
Also see the \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-Format\fR=<\fIoutput_format\fR>
option described below (which supports less flexibility in formatting, but
supports access to all fields).
If the command is executed in a federated cluster environment and information
about more than one cluster is to be displayed and the \fB\-h, \-\-noheader\fR
option is used, then the cluster name will be displayed before the default
output formats shown below.

The default formats with various options are:
.IP
.RS
.TP 15

.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR[=<\fIjob_id_list\fR>]
Specify a comma separated list of job IDs to display. Defaults to all jobs.
The \fB\-\-jobs\fR=<\fIjob_id_list\fR> option may be used in conjunction with
the \fB\-\-steps\fR option to print step information about specific jobs.
Note: If a list of job IDs is provided, the jobs are displayed even if
they are on hidden partitions. Since this option's argument is optional,
for proper parsing the single letter option must be followed immediately
with the value and not include a space between them. For example "\-j1008"
and not "\-j 1008".
The job ID format is "job_id[_array_id]".
Performance of the command can be measurably improved for systems with large
numbers of jobs when a single job ID is specified.
By default, this field size will be limited to 64 bytes.
Use the environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.

.IP

.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR=<\fIsort_list\fR>
Specification of the order in which records should be reported.
This uses the same field specification as the <output_format>.
The long format option "cluster" can also be used to sort jobs or job steps by
cluster name (e.g. federated jobs).
Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields
separated by commas.
The field specifications may be preceded by "+" or "\-" for
ascending (default) and descending order respectively.
For example, a sort value of "P,U" will sort the
records by partition name then by user id.
The default value of sort for jobs is "P,t,\-p" (increasing partition
name then within a given partition by increasing job state and then
decreasing priority).
The default value of sort for job steps is "P,i" (increasing partition
name then within a given partition by increasing step id).
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-start\fR
Report the expected start time and resources to be allocated for pending jobs
in order of increasing start time.
This is equivalent to the following options:

\fB\-\-sort=S\fR and \fB\-\-states=PENDING\fR.
Any of these options may be explicitly changed as desired by
combining the \fB\-\-start\fR option with other option values
(e.g. to use a different output format).
The expected start time of pending jobs is only available if the
Slurm is configured to use the backfill scheduling plugin.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-states\fR=<\fIstate_list\fR>
Specify the states of jobs to view. Accepts a comma separated list of
state names or "all". If "all" is specified then jobs of all states will be
reported. If no state is specified then pending, running, and completing
jobs are reported. See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for a list of
valid states. Both extended and compact forms are valid.
Note the \fB<state_list>\fR supplied is case insensitive ("pd" and "PD" are
equivalent).
.IP

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-steps\fR[=<\fIstep_list\fR>]
Specify the job steps to view. This flag indicates that a comma separated list
of job steps to view follows without an equal sign (see examples).
The job step format is "job_id[_array_id].step_id". Defaults to all job
steps. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing
the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value
and not include a space between them. For example "\-s1008.0" and not
"\-s 1008.0".

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsqueue\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmctld\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsqueue\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsqueue\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to \fBslurmctld\fR from loops in shell scripts or other
programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to \fBsqueue\fR to the minimum
necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsqueue\fR options may be set via environment variables. These
environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed
below. (Note: Command line options will always override these settings.)

.TP 20
\fBSLURM_BITSTR_LEN\fR

\fBSLURM_TIME_FORMAT\fR
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of \fIstandard\fR, the
default value, generates output in the form "year\-month\-dateThour:minute:second".
A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").
