.TH sinfo "1" "Slurm Commands" "November 2016" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sinfo \- view information about Slurm nodes and partitions.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsinfo\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsinfo\fR is used to view partition and node information for a
system running Slurm.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Display information about all partitions. This causes information to be
displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that
are unavailable to user's group.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bgl\fR
Display information about bglblocks (on Blue Gene systems only).

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dead\fR
If set only report state information for non\-responding (dead) nodes.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
If set, do not group node information on multiple nodes unless
their configurations to be reported are identical. Otherwise
cpu count, memory size, and disk space for nodes will be listed
with the minimum value followed by a "+" for nodes with the
same partition and state (e.g., "250+").

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Show all partitions from the federation if a member of one.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a message describing all \fBsinfo\fR options.
.TP

\fB\-\-hide\fR
Do not display information about hidden partitions. By default, partitions
that are configured as hidden or are not available to the user's group
will not be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).

.TP
\fB\-i <seconds>\fR, \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
Print the state on a periodic basis.
Sleep for the indicated number of seconds between reports.
By default, prints a time stamp with the header.

.TP
\fB\-\-local\fR
Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation
(if any). Overrides \-\-federation.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Print more detailed information.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to.  Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.
A value of of '\fIall\fR' will query to run on all clusters.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.
This option implicitly sets the \fB\-\-local\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-n <nodes>\fR, \fB\-\-nodes=<nodes>\fR
Print information only about the specified node(s).
Multiple nodes may be comma separated or expressed using a
node range expression. For example "linux[00\-07]" would
indicate eight nodes, "linux00" through "linux07."
Performance of the command can be measurably improved for systems with large
numbers of nodes when a single node name is specified.

.TP
\fB\-\-noconvert\fR
Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to
2G).

.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-Node\fR
Print information in a node\-oriented format with one line per node.
The default is to print information in a partition\-oriented format.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.

.TP
\fB\-o <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<output_format>\fR
Specify the information to be displayed using an \fBsinfo\fR
format string. Format strings transparently used by \fBsinfo\fR
when running with various options are

.IP
In the above format strings, the use of "#" represents the
maximum length of any partition name or node list to be printed.
A pass is made over the records to be printed to establish the size in order
to align the sinfo output, then a second pass is made over the records to
print them.
Note that the literal character "#" itself is not a valid field length
specification, but is only used to document this behaviour.

.TP
\fB\-p <partition>\fR, \fB\-\-partition=<partition>\fR
Print information only about the specified partition(s). Multiple partitions
are separated by commas.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-responding\fR
If set only report state information for responding nodes.

.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-list\-reasons\fR
List reasons nodes are in the down, drained, fail or failing state.
When nodes are in these states Slurm supports optional inclusion
of a "reason" string by an administrator.
This option will display the first 20 characters of the reason
field and list of nodes with that reason for all nodes that are,
by default, down, drained, draining or failing.
This option may be used with other node filtering options
(e.g. \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-t\fR, \fB\-n\fR),
however, combinations of these options that result in a
list of nodes that are not down or drained or failing will
not produce any output.
When used with \fB\-l\fR the output additionally includes
the current node state.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-summarize\fR
List only a partition state summary with no node state details.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.

.TP
\fB\-S <sort_list>\fR, \fB\-\-sort=<sort_list>\fR
Specification of the order in which records should be reported.
This uses the same field specification as the <output_format>.
Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields
separated by commas.  The field specifications may be preceded
by "+" or "\-" for ascending (default) and descending order
respectively.  The partition field specification, "P", may be
preceded by a "#" to report partitions in the same order that
they appear in Slurm's  configuration file, \fBslurm.conf\fR.
For example, a sort value of "+P,\-m" requests that records
be printed in order of increasing partition name and within a
partition by decreasing memory size.  The default value of sort
is "#P,\-t" (partitions ordered as configured then decreasing
node state).  If the \fB\-\-Node\fB option is selected, the
default sort value is "N" (increasing node name).

.TP
\fB\-t <states>\fR , \fB\-\-states=<states>\fR
List nodes only having the given state(s).  Multiple states
may be comma separated and the comparison is case insensitive.
Possible values include (case insensitive): ALLOC, ALLOCATED,
COMP, COMPLETING, DOWN, DRAIN (for node in DRAINING or DRAINED
states), DRAINED, DRAINING, ERR, ERROR, FAIL, FUTURE, FUTR,
IDLE, MAINT, MIX, MIXED, NO_RESPOND, NPC, PERFCTRS,
POWER_DOWN, POWER_UP, RESV, RESERVED, UNK, and UNKNOWN.
By default nodes in the specified state are reported whether
they are responding or not.
The \fB\-\-dead\fR and \fB\-\-responding\fR options may be
used to filtering nodes by the responding flag.

.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-reservation\fR
Only display information about Slurm reservations.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief message listing the \fBsinfo\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Provide detailed event logging through program execution.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

\fB*\fR
The node is presently not responding and will not be allocated
any new work.  If the node remains non\-responsive, it will
be placed in the \fBDOWN\fR state (except in the case of
\fBCOMPLETING\fR, \fBDRAINED\fR, \fBDRAINING\fR,

parameter description in the \fBslurm.conf\fR man page for
more information.
.TP

node\fR command in the \fBscontrol\fR(1) man page or the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP
\fBERROR\fR
The node is currently in an error state and not capable of running any jobs.
Slurm can automatically place nodes in this state if some failure occurs.
System administrators may also explicitly place nodes in this state. If
a node resumes normal operation, Slurm can automatically
return it to service. See the \fBReturnToService\fR
and \fBSlurmdTimeout\fR parameter descriptions in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.
.TP

The node is currently in the process of being powered up.
.TP
\fBRESERVED\fR
The node is in an advanced reservation and not generally available.
.TP
\fBUNKNOWN\fR
The Slurm controller has just started and the node's state
has not yet been determined.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

.TP
\fBSLURM_TIME_FORMAT\fR
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of \fIstandard\fR, the
default value, generates output in the form "year\-month\-dateThour:minute:second".
A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").
