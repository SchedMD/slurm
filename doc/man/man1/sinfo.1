.TH sinfo "1" "Slurm Commands" "July 2020" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sinfo \- View information about Slurm nodes and partitions.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsinfo\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsinfo\fR is used to view partition and node information for a
system running Slurm.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Display information about all partitions. This causes information to be
displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that
are unavailable to the user's group.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dead\fR
If set, only report state information for non\-responding (dead) nodes.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
If set, do not group node information on multiple nodes unless
their configurations to be reported are identical. Otherwise
cpu count, memory size, and disk space for nodes will be listed
with the minimum value followed by a "+" for nodes with the
same partition and state (e.g. "250+").

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Show all partitions from the federation if a member of one.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a message describing all \fBsinfo\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-\-hide\fR
Do not display information about hidden partitions. Partitions
that are configured as hidden or are not available to the user's group
will not be displayed. This is the default behavior.

.TP
\fB\-i <seconds>\fR, \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
Print the state on a periodic basis.
Sleep for the indicated number of seconds between reports.
By default prints a time stamp with the header.

.TP
\fB\-\-local\fR
Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation
(if any). Overrides \fB\-\-federation\fR.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Print more detailed information.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to.  Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.
A value of of '\fBall\fR' will query all clusters. Note that the
\fBSlurmDBD\fR must be up for this option to work properly.
This option implicitly sets the \fB\-\-local\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-n <nodes>\fR, \fB\-\-nodes=<nodes>\fR
Print information about the specified node(s).
Multiple nodes may be comma separated or expressed using a
node range expression (e.g. "linux[00\-17]")
Limiting the query to just the relevant nodes can measurably improve the
performance of the command for large clusters.

.TP
\fB\-\-noconvert\fR
Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to
2G).

.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-Node\fR
Print information in a node\-oriented format with one line per node
and partition. That is, if a node belongs to more than one partition, then one
line for each node\-partition pair will be shown.
If \fB\-\-partition\fR is also specified, then only one line per node in this
partition is shown.
The default is to print information in a partition\-oriented format.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.

.TP
\fB\-o <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<output_format>\fR
Specify the information to be displayed using an \fBsinfo\fR
format string.
If the command is executed in a federated cluster environment and information
about more than one cluster is to be displayed and the \fB\-h, \-\-noheader\fR
option is used, then the cluster name will be displayed before the default
output formats shown below.
Format strings transparently used by \fBsinfo\fR when running with various
options are:
.RS
.TP 15
.I "default"
"%#P %.5a %.10l %.6D %.6t %N"
.TP
.I "\-\-summarize"
"%#P %.5a %.10l %.16F  %N"

.TP
.I "\-\-long \-\-list\-reasons"
"%20E %12U %19H %6t %N"
.RE

.IP
In the above format strings, the use of "#" represents the
maximum length of any partition name or node list to be printed.
A pass is made over the records to be printed to establish the size in order
to align the sinfo output, then a second pass is made over the records to
print them.
Note that the literal character "#" itself is not a valid field length
specification, but is only used to document this behaviour.

.TP
\fB\-p <partition>\fR, \fB\-\-partition=<partition>\fR
Print information only about the specified partition(s). Multiple partitions
are separated by commas.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-responding\fR
If set only report state information for responding nodes.

.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-list\-reasons\fR
List reasons nodes are in the down, drained, fail or failing state.
When nodes are in these states Slurm supports the inclusion
of a "reason" string by an administrator.
This option will display the first 20 characters of the reason
field and list of nodes with that reason for all nodes that are,
by default, down, drained, draining or failing.
This option may be used with other node filtering options
(e.g. \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-t\fR, \fB\-n\fR),
however, combinations of these options that result in a
list of nodes that are not down or drained or failing will
not produce any output.
When used with \fB\-l\fR the output additionally includes
the current node state.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-summarize\fR
List only a partition state summary with no node state details.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.

.TP
\fB\-S <sort_list>\fR, \fB\-\-sort=<sort_list>\fR
Specification of the order in which records should be reported.
This uses the same field specification as the <output_format>.
Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields
separated by commas.  The field specifications may be preceded
by "+" or "\-" for ascending (default) and descending order
respectively.  The partition field specification, "P", may be
preceded by a "#" to report partitions in the same order that
they appear in Slurm's  configuration file, \fBslurm.conf\fR.
For example, a sort value of "+P,\-m" requests that records
be printed in order of increasing partition name and within a
partition by decreasing memory size.  The default value of sort
is "#P,\-t" (partitions ordered as configured then decreasing
node state).  If the \fB\-\-Node\fR option is selected, the
default sort value is "N" (increasing node name).

.TP
\fB\-t <states>\fR , \fB\-\-states=<states>\fR
List nodes only having the given state(s).  Multiple states
may be comma separated and the comparison is case insensitive.
Possible values include (case insensitive): ALLOC, ALLOCATED,
COMP, COMPLETING, DOWN, DRAIN (for node in DRAINING or DRAINED
states), DRAINED, DRAINING, FAIL, FUTURE, FUTR,
IDLE, MAINT, MIX, MIXED, NO_RESPOND, NPC, PERFCTRS,
POWER_DOWN, POWERING_DOWN, POWER_UP, RESV, RESERVED, UNK, and UNKNOWN.
By default nodes in the specified state are reported whether
they are responding or not.
The \fB\-\-dead\fR and \fB\-\-responding\fR options may be
used to filter nodes by the corresponding flag.

.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-reservation\fR
Only display information about Slurm reservations.

\fBNOTE\fR: This option causes \fBsinfo\fR to ignore most other options,
which are focused on partition and node information.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief message listing the \fBsinfo\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Provide detailed event logging through program execution.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

Whether jobs allocated resources in this partition can/will oversubscribe
those compute resources (e.g. CPUs).
\fBNO\fR indicates resources are never oversubscribed.
\fBEXCLUSIVE\fR indicates whole nodes are dedicated to jobs
(equivalent to srun \-\-exclusive option, may be used even
with select/cons_res managing individual processors).
\fBFORCE\fR indicates resources are always available to be oversubscribed.
\fBYES\fR indicates resource may be oversubscribed, if requested by the job's
resource allocation.

\fBNOTE\fR: If OverSubscribe is set to FORCE or YES,
the OversubScribe value will be appended to the output.
.TP
\fBSTATE\fR
State of the nodes.
Possible states include: allocated, completing, down,
drained, draining, fail, failing, future, idle, maint, mixed,
perfctrs, power_down, power_up, reserved, and unknown.
Their abbreviated forms are: alloc, comp, down, drain, drng,
fail, failg, futr, idle, maint, mix, npc, pow_dn, pow_up, resv,
and unk respectively.

\fBNOTE\fR: The suffix "*" identifies nodes that are presently
not responding.
.TP

\fB*\fR
The node is presently not responding and will not be allocated
any new work.  If the node remains non\-responsive, it will
be placed in the \fBDOWN\fR state (except in the case of
\fBCOMPLETING\fR, \fBDRAINED\fR, \fBDRAINING\fR,

epilog program (if any) has terminated. See the \fBEpilog\fR
parameter description in the \fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for
more information.
.TP
\fBDOWN\fR
The node is unavailable for use. Slurm can automatically
place nodes in this state if some failure occurs. System
administrators may also explicitly place nodes in this state. If
a node resumes normal operation, Slurm can automatically
return it to service. See the \fBReturnToService\fR
and \fBSlurmdTimeout\fR parameter descriptions in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for more information.

for more information.
.TP
\fBDRAINING\fR
The node is currently executing a job, but will not be allocated
additional jobs. The node state will be changed to state
\fBDRAINED\fR when the last job on it completes. Nodes enter

has not yet been determined.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsinfo\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmctld\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsinfo\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsinfo\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure
calls to \fBslurmctld\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure
that programs limit calls to \fBsinfo\fR to the minimum necessary for the
information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsinfo\fR options may
be set via environment variables. These environment variables,
along with their corresponding options, are listed below.
\fBNOTE\fR: Command line options will always override these settings.

.TP
\fBSLURM_TIME_FORMAT\fR
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of \fIstandard\fR, the
default value, generates output in the form "year\-month\-dateThour:minute:second".
A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").
