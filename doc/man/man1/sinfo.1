.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsinfo\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsinfo\fR is used to view partition and node information for a
system running Slurm.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Display information about all partitions. This causes information to be
displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that
are unavailable to the user's group.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to. Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.
A value of '\fBall\fR' will query all clusters.
Note that the \fBslurmdbd\fR must be up for this option to work properly, unless
running in a federation with either \fBFederationParameters=fed_display\fR
configured or the \fB\-\-federation\fR option set.
This option implicitly sets the \fB\-\-local\fR option.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dead\fR
Only show nodes that have unexpectedly stopped responding. This may not show
nodes in a POWERED_DOWN state since they are expected to be down.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
If set, do not group node information on multiple nodes unless
their configurations to be reported are identical. Otherwise
cpu count, memory size, and disk space for nodes will be listed
with the minimum value followed by a "+" for nodes with the
same partition and state (e.g. "250+").
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Show all partitions from the federation if a member of one.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-future\fR
Report nodes in FUTURE state.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR=<\fIoutput_format\fR>
Specify the information to be displayed using an \fBsinfo\fR
format string.
If the command is executed in a federated cluster environment and information
about more than one cluster is to be displayed and the \fB\-h, \-\-noheader\fR
option is used, then the cluster name will be displayed before the default
output formats shown below.
Format strings transparently used by \fBsinfo\fR when running with various
options are:

In the above format strings, the use of "#" represents the
maximum length of any partition name or node list to be printed.
A pass is made over the records to be printed to establish the size in order
to align the sinfo output, then a second pass is made over the records to
print them.
Note that the literal character "#" itself is not a valid field length
specification, but is only used to document this behavior.

The format of each field is "%[[.]size]type[suffix]"

Dump information as JSON using the default data_parser plugin or explicit
data_parser with parameters. All information is dumped, even if it would
normally not be. Sorting and formatting arguments passed to other options are
ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-list\-reasons\fR
List reasons nodes are in the down, drained, fail or failing state.
When nodes are in these states Slurm supports the inclusion
of a "reason" string by an administrator.
This option will display the first 20 characters of the reason
field and list of nodes with that reason for all nodes that are,
by default, down, drained, draining or failing.
This option may be used with other node filtering options
(e.g. \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-t\fR, \fB\-n\fR),
however, combinations of these options that result in a
list of nodes that are not down or drained or failing will
not produce any output.
When used with \fB\-l\fR the output additionally includes
the current node state.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-local\fR
Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation
(if any). Overrides \fB\-\-federation\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Print more detailed information.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-noconvert\fR
Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to
2G).
.IP

.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-Node\fR
Print information in a node\-oriented format with one line per node
and partition. That is, if a node belongs to more than one partition, then one
line for each node\-partition pair will be shown.
If \fB\-\-partition\fR is also specified, then only one line per node in this
partition is shown.
The default is to print information in a partition\-oriented format.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nodes\fR=<\fInodes\fR>
Print information about the specified node(s).
Multiple nodes may be comma separated or expressed using a
node range expression (e.g. "linux[00\-17]")
Limiting the query to just the relevant nodes can measurably improve the
performance of the command for large clusters.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partition\fR=<\fIpartition\fR>
Print information about the node(s) in the specified partition(s).
Multiple partitions are separated by commas.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-reservation\fR
Only display information about Slurm reservations.

\fBNOTE\fR: This option causes \fBsinfo\fR to ignore most other options,
which are focused on partition and node information.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-responding\fR
Exclude any nodes that have unexpectedly stopped responding. This is the
opposite of \fB\-\-dead\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR=<\fIsort_list\fR>
Specification of the order in which records should be reported.
This uses the same field specification as the <output_format>.
Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields
separated by commas. The field specifications may be preceded
by "+" or "\-" for ascending (default) and descending order
respectively. The partition field specification, "P", may be
preceded by a "#" to report partitions in the same order that
they appear in Slurm's configuration file, \fBslurm.conf\fR.
For example, a sort value of "+P,\-m" requests that records
be printed in order of increasing partition name and within a
partition by decreasing memory size. The default value of sort
is "#P,\-t" (partitions ordered as configured then decreasing
node state). If the \fB\-\-Node\fR option is selected, the
default sort value is "N" (increasing node name).
.IP

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-states\fR=<\fIstates\fR>
List nodes only having the given state(s). Multiple states
may be comma separated and the comparison is case insensitive.
If the states are separated by '+', then the nodes must be in all states.
The state can be prefixed with '~' which will invert the result of match.
Possible values include (case insensitive): ALLOC, ALLOCATED, BLOCKED, CLOUD,
COMP, COMPLETING, DOWN, DRAIN (for node in DRAINING or DRAINED
states), DRAINED, DRAINING, FAIL, FUTURE, FUTR,
IDLE, MAINT, MIX, MIXED, NO_RESPOND, NPC, PERFCTRS, PLANNED,
POWER_DOWN, POWERING_DOWN, POWERED_DOWN, POWERING_UP, REBOOT_ISSUED,
REBOOT_REQUESTED, RESV, RESERVED, UNK, and UNKNOWN.
By default nodes in the specified state are reported whether
they are responding or not.
The \fB\-\-dead\fR and \fB\-\-responding\fR options may be
used to filter nodes by the corresponding flag.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-summarize\fR
List only a partition state summary with no node state details.
This is ignored if the \fB\-\-format\fR option is specified.
.IP

.TP

Dump information as YAML using the default data_parser plugin or explicit
data_parser with parameters. All information is dumped, even if it would
normally not be. Sorting and formatting arguments passed to other options are
ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsinfo\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmctld\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsinfo\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsinfo\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure
calls to \fBslurmctld\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure
that programs limit calls to \fBsinfo\fR to the minimum necessary for the
information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsinfo\fR options may
be set via environment variables. These environment variables,
along with their corresponding options, are listed below.
\fBNOTE\fR: Command line options will always override these settings.

.TP
\fBcompact\fR
Output JSON as compact as possible.
.IP

.TP
\fBpretty\fR
Output JSON in pretty format to make it more readable.
.IP
.RE

.TP
\fBSLURM_TIME_FORMAT\fR
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of \fIstandard\fR, the
default value, generates output in the form "year\-month\-dateThour:minute:second".
A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").
