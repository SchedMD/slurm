.SH "NAME"
sreport \- Generate reports from the slurm accounting data.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsreport\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsreport\fR is used to generate reports of job usage and cluster
utilization for Slurm jobs saved to the Slurm Database,
\fBslurmdbd\fR. Report data comes from hourly, daily, and monthly rollups of
accounting data that occur automatically in the background. Data will be pulled
from the rollup table with the longest interval that can satisfy the requested
report period. For example, a report on the time range "Start=01/01 End=03/01"
will be able to pull from the monthly rollup table, while a report with
"Start=01/01-03:00 End=03/01" will need to use the hourly rollup table.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all_clusters\fR
Use all clusters instead of only the cluster from which the command was
executed.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-cluster\fR
The cluster(s) to generate reports for. Default is local cluster, unless the
local cluster is currently part of a federation and in that case generate a
report for all clusters in the current federation. If the clusters included
in a federation vary through time, use this option to identify the clusters
to be included in report. Implies \-\-local.

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Generate a report for the federation if a member of one.

\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR

\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR

.TP
\fB\-t\fR <\fItime_format\fR>
Specify the output time format. Time format options are case
insensitive and may be abbreviated. The default format is Minutes.
Supported time format options are listed in the \fBtime\fP command
section below.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tres\fR=<\fItres_names\fR>
Trackable resource (TRES) to report values for.
By default CPU resource use is reported (except for reservation reports. All
TRES types reserved by a reservation will be shown by default unless overridden
with this option).
Multiple TRES names may be separated using a comma separated list for all
reports except the job reports, which can only support a single TRES name, or
"ALL" for all TRES.

The "Reported" Billing TRES is calculated from the largest Billing TRES of each
node multiplied by the time frame. For example, if a node is part of multiple
partitions and each has a different TRESBillingWeights defined the Billing TRES
for the node will be the highest of the partitions. If TRESBillingWeights is
not defined on any partition for a node then the Billing TRES will be equal to
the number of CPUs on the node.

TRES node usage is no longer reported in percent format or in Cluster
Utilization. Please use TRES CPU instead.
The main issue with using node is in most configurations multiple jobs are able
to run on the same node. This makes TRES node accounting count the same node
multiple times in the same period. In exclusive node configurations, CPU
accounting returns the same usage node accounting would.

\fBNOTE\fR: If \fBOverSubscribe\fR is configured to \fBFORCE\fR or \fBYES\fR
in your slurm.conf and the system is not configured to use preemption
(\fBPreemptMode=OFF\fR) accounting can easily grow to values greater than
the actual utilization. It may be common on such systems to get error messages
in the slurmdbd log stating: "We have more allocated time than is possible."

.SH "REPORT DESCRIPTION"

.TP
.B cluster AccountUtilizationByUser
This report will display account utilization as it appears on the
hierarchical tree. Starting with the specified account or the
root account by default this report will list the underlying
usage with a sum on each level. Use the 'tree' option to span
the tree for better visibility.

\fBNOTE\fR: Idle reservation time will be split evenly among accounts/users
given access to it. When a reservation is assigned to whole accounts, the
time will be counted in the association for the accounts, not the user
associations in the accounts. In this case, the usage of a parent account can
be larger than the sum of its children.
.IP

.TP
.B cluster AccountUtilizationByQOS
This report will display account utilization as it appears on the
hierarchical tree. Starting with the root account by default, or with the
specified account, this report will list the underlying usage in each
account, with a sum on each level. Use the 'tree' option to expand
the tree for better visibility. Users are not displayed here, only parent
accounts.

\fBNOTE\fR: Idle reservation time will be split evenly among accounts that have
access to it. Since no QOS is directly connected with the idle time, the
time is counted against the default QOS of the account, or 'normal' when
there is no default.

\fBNOTE\fR: If you reroll data in the database and have changed the default
QOS on an association to something other than what was there at the time
of the original rollup, you can get different data.

.TP
.B cluster UserUtilizationByAccount
This report will display users by account in order of utilization without
grouping multiple accounts by user into one, but displaying them
on separate lines.
.IP

.TP
.B cluster UserUtilizationByWCKey
This report will display users by wckey in order of utilization without
grouping multiple wckey by user into one, but displaying them
on separate lines.
.IP

.TP
.B cluster Utilization
This report will display total usage divided amongst Allocated, Down,
Planned Down, Idle, and Planned time for selected clusters.

Refer to the later section for descriptions of these fields.

Note: Reservations created with the IGNORE_JOBS flag are not tracked
in the Cluster Utilization report due to the fact that allowing any
current/active jobs to continue to run in the reservation introduces the
possibility for them to be accounted for incorrectly.
The jobs in these reservations will be tracked as normal rather than
being bundled in the reservation time, as they are with reservations that
do not have the IGNORE_JOBS flag.

Note: The default view for the "Cluster Utilization" report includes the
following fields: Cluster, Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, Idle, Planned,
Reported. You can include additional fields like OverCommitted and TresCount
fields with the \fBFormat\fP option. The TresName will also be included if
using the \fB\-T, \-\-tres <tres_names>\fR option.
.RE
.IP

.TP
.B cluster WCKeyUtilizationByUser
This report will display wckey utilization sorted by WCKey name for
each user on each cluster.
.IP

.TP
.B job SizesByAccount
This report will display the amount of time used for job ranges
specified by the 'grouping=' option. Only a single level in the tree
is displayed defaulting to the root dir. If you specify other
accounts with the 'account=' option sreport will use those accounts as
the root account and you will receive the aggregated totals of each listed
account plus their sub accounts.
.IP

.TP
.B job SizesByAccountAndWckey
This report is very similar to SizesByAccount with the difference being
each account is pair with wckeys so the identifier is account:wckey
instead of just account so there will most likely be multiple accounts
listed depending on the number of wckeys used.
.IP

.TP
.B job SizesByWckey
This report will display the amount of time for each wckey for job ranges
specified by the 'grouping=' option.
.IP

.TP
.B reservation Utilization
This report will display total usage for reservations on the systems.
Note: Time requests on this report will not truncate the time the reservation
used, only the reservations that ran at any time during the period requested.
.IP

.TP
.B user TopUsage
Displays the top users on a cluster, i.e. users with the highest usage.
By default users are sorted by CPUTime, but the \-T, \-\-tres option will
sort users by the first TRES specified.

Use the group option to group accounts together.
The default is to have a different line for each user account combination.
