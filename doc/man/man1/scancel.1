.SH "NAME"
scancel \- Used to signal jobs or job steps that are under the control of Slurm.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBscancel\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fIjob_id\fR[_\fIarray_id\fR][.\fIstep_id\fR]] [\fIjob_id\fR[_\fIarray_id\fR][.\fIstep_id\fR]...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBscancel\fR is used to signal or cancel jobs, job arrays or job steps.
An arbitrary number of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job
specification filters or a space separated list of specific job and/or
job step IDs.
If the job ID of a job array is specified with an array ID value and the job
associated with the array ID value has been split from the array, then only that
job array element will be cancelled.
If the job ID of a job array is specified without an array ID value or the
array ID value corresponds to a job that has not been split from the array,
then all job array elements will be cancelled.
While a heterogeneous job is in a PENDING state, only the entire job can be
cancelled rather than its individual components.
A request to cancel an individual component of a heterogeneous job while in
a PENDING state will return an error.
After the job has begun execution, an individual component can be cancelled
except for component zero. If component zero is cancelled, the whole het job is
cancelled.
A job or job step can only be signaled by the owner of that job or user root.
If an attempt is made by an unauthorized user to signal a job or job step, an
error message will be printed and the job will not be signaled.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-account\fR=\fIaccount\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs under this charge account.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR
By default, signals other than SIGKILL are not sent to the batch step (the shell
script). With this option \fBscancel\fR signals only the batch step, but not
any other steps.
This is useful when the shell script has to trap the signal and take some
application defined action.
Most shells cannot handle signals while a command is running (i.e. is a child
process of the batch step), so the shell needs to wait until the command ends to
then handle the signal.
Children of the batch step are not signaled with this option. If this is
desired, use \fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR instead.
\fBNOTE\fR: If used with \fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR, this option is ignored.
\fBNOTE\fR: This option is not applicable if \fIstep_id\fR is specified.
\fBNOTE\fR: The shell itself may exit upon receipt of many signals.
You may avoid this by explicitly trap signals within the shell
script (e.g. "trap <arg> <signals>"). See the shell documentation
for details.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Cluster to issue commands to. Implies \fB\-\-ctld\fR.
Note that the \fBslurmdbd\fR must be up for this option to work properly, unless
running in a federation with \fBFederationParameters=fed_display\fR configured.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-ctld\fR
If this option is not used with \fB\-\-interactive\fR,
\fB\-\-sibling\fR, federated job ids, or specific step ids, then this issues a
single request to the slurmctld to signal all jobs matching the specified
filters. This greatly improves the performance of slurmctld and scancel.
Otherwise, this option causes scancel to send each job signal request to the
slurmctld daemon rather than directly to the slurmd daemons, which increases
overhead, but offers better fault tolerance. \fB\-\-ctld\fR is the default
behavior on when the \fB\-\-clusters\fR option is used.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cron\fR
Confirm request to cancel a job submitted by scrontab. This option only has
effect with the "explicit_scancel" option is set in \fBScronParameters\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR
By default, signals other than SIGKILL are not sent to the batch step (the shell
script). With this option \fBscancel\fR also signals the batch script and its
children processes.
Most shells cannot handle signals while a command is running (i.e. is a child
process of the batch step), so the shell needs to wait until the command ends to
then handle the signal.
Unlike \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR, children of the batch step
are also signaled with this option.
\fBNOTE\fR: srun steps are also children of the batch step, so steps are also
signaled with this option.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all \fBscancel\fR options.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hurry\fR

\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-nodelist=\fIhost1,host2,...\fR
Cancel any jobs using any of the given hosts. The list may be specified as
a comma\-separated list of hosts, a range of hosts (host[1\-5,7,...] for
example), or a filename. The host list will be assumed to be a filename only
if it contains a "/" character.

ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fIjob_id\fP
The Slurm job ID to be signaled.
.IP

.TP
\fIstep_id\fP
The step ID of the job step to be signaled.
If not specified, the operation is performed at the level of a job.

If neither \fB\-\-batch\fR nor \fB\-\-signal\fR are used,
the entire job will be terminated.

When \fB\-\-batch\fR is used, the batch shell processes will be signaled.
The child processes of the shell will not be signaled by Slurm, but
the shell may forward the signal.

When \fB\-\-batch\fR is not used but \fB\-\-signal\fR is used,
then all job steps will be signaled, but the batch script itself
will not be signaled.
.IP

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
When executing \fBscancel\fR without the \fB\-\-ctld\fR option; or with the
\fB\-\-ctld\fR option and \fB\-\-interactive\fR, \fB\-\-sibling\fR, or specific
step ids; a remote procedure call is sent to \fBslurmctld\fR to get all the
jobs. \fBscancel\fR then sends a signal job remote procedure call for each job
that matches the requested filters.

When executing \fBscancel\fR with the \fB\-\-ctld\fR option and without
\fB\-\-interactive\fR, \fB\-\-sibling\fR, or specific step ids, a single
remote procedure call is sent to \fBslurmctld\fR to signal all jobs matching
the requested filters. It is therefore recommended to use the \fB\-\-ctld\fR
option in order to reduce the number of remote procedure calls sent to the
\fBslurmctld\fR.

.PP
If enough calls from \fBscancel\fR or other Slurm client commands that send
remote procedure calls to the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon come in at once, it can
result in a degradation of performance of the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon, possibly
resulting in a denial of service.

.PP
Do not run \fBscancel\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to \fBslurmctld\fR from loops in shell scripts or other
programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to \fBscancel\fR to the minimum
necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

.SH "NOTES"
.LP
If multiple filters are supplied (e.g. \fB\-\-partition\fR and \fB\-\-name\fR)
only the jobs satisfying all of the filtering options will be signaled.
.LP
Cancelling a job step will not result in the job being terminated.
The job must be cancelled to release a resource allocation.
.LP
To cancel a job, invoke \fBscancel\fR without \-\-signal option. This
will send first a SIGCONT to all steps to eventually wake them up followed by
a SIGTERM, then wait the KillWait duration defined in the slurm.conf file
and finally if they have not terminated send a SIGKILL. This gives
time for the running job/step(s) to clean up.
.LP
If a signal value of "KILL" is sent to an entire job, this will cancel
the active job steps but not cancel the job itself.

.SH "AUTHORIZATION"

When using SlurmDBD, users who have an AdminLevel defined (Operator
or Admin) and users who are account coordinators are given the
authority to invoke scancel on other users jobs.
