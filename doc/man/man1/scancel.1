.TH scancel "1" "Slurm Commands" "April 2015" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
scancel \- Used to signal jobs or job steps that are under the control of Slurm.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBscancel\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fIjob_id\fR[_\fIarray_id\fR][.\fIstep_id\fR]] [\fIjob_id\fR[_\fIarray_id\fR][.\fIstep_id\fR]...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBscancel\fR is used to signal or cancel jobs, job arrays or job steps.
An arbitrary number of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job
specification filters or a space separated list of specific job and/or
job step IDs.
If the job ID of a job array is specified with an array ID value then only that
job array element will be cancelled.
If the job ID of a job array is specified without an array ID value then all
job array elements will be cancelled.
A job or job step can only be signaled by the owner of that job or user root.
If an attempt is made by an unauthorized user to signal a job or job step, an
error message will be printed and the job will not be signaled.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-account\fR=\fIaccount\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs under this charge account.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR
Signal only the batch step (the shell script), but not any other steps
nor any children of the shell script. This is useful when the shell
script has to trap the signal and take some application defined action.
This is not applicable if \fIstep_id\fR is specified.
NOTE: The shell itself may exit upon receipt of many signals.
You may avoid this by explicitly trap signals within the shell
script (e.g. "trap <arg> <signals>"). See the shell documentation
for details.
Also see the \fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR option.

.TP
\fB-\-ctld\fR
Send the job signal request to the slurmctld daemon rather than directly to the
slurmd daemons. This increases overhead, but offers better fault tolerance.
This is the default behavior on architectures using front end nodes (e.g.
BlueGene and Cray computers) or when the \fB\-\-clusters\fR option is used.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR
Signal all steps associated with the job including any batch step (the shell
script plus all of its child processes).
By default, signals other than SIGKILL are not sent to the batch step.
Also see the \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all \fBscancel\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
Interactive mode. Confirm each job_id.step_id before performing the cancel operation.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
Clusters to issue commands to.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-jobname\fR=\fIjob_name\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR=\fIjob_name\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this job name.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partition\fR=\fIpartition_name\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs in this partition.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-qos\fR=\fIqos\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this quality of service.

.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Do not report an error if the specified job is already completed.
This option is incompatible with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR option.


.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-reservation\fR=\fIreservation_name\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this reservation name.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fIsignal_name\fR
The name or number of the signal to send.  If this option is not used
the specified job or step will be terminated. \fBNote\fR. If this option
is used the signal is sent directly to the slurmd where the job is
running bypassing the slurmctld thus the job state will not change even
if the signal is delivered to it. Use the \fIscontrol\fR command if
you want the job state change be known to slurmctld.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-state\fR=\fIjob_state_name\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs in this
state. \fIjob_state_name\fR may have a value of either "PENDING",
"RUNNING" or "SUSPENDED".

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR=\fIuser_name\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs owned by this user.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief help message listing the \fBscancel\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print additional logging. Multiple v's increase logging detail.
This option is incompatible with the \fB\-\-quiet\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number of the scancel command.

.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-nodelist=\fIhost1,host2,...\fR
Cancel any jobs using any of the given hosts.  The list may be specified as
a comma\-separated list of hosts, a range of hosts (host[1\-5,7,...] for
example), or a filename. The host list will be assumed to be a filename only
if it contains a "/" character.

.TP
\fB\-\-wckey\fR=\fIwckey\fR
Restrict the scancel operation to jobs using this workload
characterization key.

.TP
ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fIjob_id\fP
The Slurm job ID to be signaled.

.TP
\fIstep_id\fP
The step ID of the job step to be signaled.
If not specified, the operation is performed at the level of a job.

If neither \fB\-\-batch\fR nor \fB\-\-signal\fR are used,
the entire job will be terminated.

When \fB\-\-batch\fR is used, the batch shell processes will be signaled.
The child processes of the shell will not be signalled by Slurm, but
the shell may forward the signal.

When \fB\-\-batch\fR is not used but \fB\-\-signal\fR is used,
then all job steps will be signalled, but the batch script itself
will not be signalled.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBscancel\fR options may be set via environment variables. These
environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.

.SH "NOTES"
.LP
If multiple filters are supplied (e.g. \fB\-\-partition\fR and \fB\-\-name\fR)
only the jobs satisfying all of the filtering options will be signaled.
.LP
Cancelling a job step will not result in the job being terminated.
The job must be cancelled to release a resource allocation.
.LP
To cancel a job, invoke \fBscancel\fR without \-\-signal option.  This
will send first a SIGCONT to all steps to eventually wake them up followed by
a SIGTERM, then wait the KillWait duration defined in the slurm.conf file
and finally if they have not terminated send a SIGKILL.  This gives
time for the running job/step(s) to clean up.
.LP
If a signal value of "KILL" is sent to an entire job, this will cancel
the active job steps but not cancel the job itself.
.LP
On Cray systems, all signals \fBexcept\fR
SIGCHLD, SIGCONT, SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, SIGURG, or SIGWINCH
cause the ALPS reservation to be released.
The job however will not be terminated except in the case of SIGKILL and
may then be used for post processing.

.SH "AUTHORIZATION"

When using the Slurm db, users who have AdminLevel's defined (Operator
or Admin) and users who are account coordinators are given the
authority to invoke scancel on other user's jobs.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
Send SIGTERM to steps 1 and 3 of job 1234:
scancel \-\-signal=TERM 1234.1 1234.3

.TP
Cancel job 1234 along with all of its steps:
scancel 1234

.TP
Send SIGKILL to all steps of job 1235, but do not cancel the job itself:
scancel \-\-signal=KILL 1235

.TP
Send SIGUSR1 to the batch shell processes of job 1236:
scancel \-\-signal=USR1 \-\-batch 1236

.TP
Cancel job all pending jobs belonging to user "bob" in partition "debug":
scancel \-\-state=PENDING \-\-user=bob \-\-partition=debug

.TP
Cancel only array ID 4 of job array 1237
scancel 1237_4
