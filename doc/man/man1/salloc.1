.TH "salloc" "1" "SLURM 2.5" "October 2012" "SLURM Commands"

.SH "NAME"
salloc \- Obtain a SLURM job allocation (a set of nodes), execute a command,
and then release the allocation when the command is finished.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
salloc [\fIoptions\fP] [<\fIcommand\fP> [\fIcommand args\fR]]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
salloc is used to allocate a SLURM job allocation, which is a set of resources
(nodes), possibly with some set of constraints (e.g. number of processors per
node).  When salloc successfully obtains the requested allocation, it then runs
the command specified by the user.  Finally, when the user specified command is
complete, salloc relinquishes the job allocation.

The command may be any program the user wishes.  Some typical commands are
xterm, a shell script containing srun commands, and srun (see the EXAMPLES
section). If no command is specified, then the value of
\fBSallocDefaultCommand\fR in slurm.conf is used. If
\fBSallocDefaultCommand\fR is not set, then \fBsalloc\fR runs the
user's default shell.

The following document describes the the influence of various options on the
allocation of cpus to jobs and tasks.

http://www.schedmd.com/slurmdocs/cpu_management.html

NOTE: The salloc logic includes support to save and restore the terminal line
settings and is designed to be executed in the foreground. If you need to
execute salloc in the background, set its standard input to some file, for
example: "salloc \-n16 a.out </dev/null &"

.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP

.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-account\fR=<\fIaccount\fR>
Charge resources used by this job to specified account.
The \fIaccount\fR is an arbitrary string. The account name may
be changed after job submission using the \fBscontrol\fR
command.

.TP
\fB\-\-acctg\-freq\fR=<\fIseconds\fR>
Define the job accounting sampling interval.
This can be used to override the \fIJobAcctGatherFrequency\fR parameter in SLURM's
configuration file, \fIslurm.conf\fR.
A value of zero disables real the periodic job sampling and provides accounting
information only on job termination (reducing SLURM interference with the job).

.TP
\fB\-B\fR \fB\-\-extra\-node\-info\fR=<\fIsockets\fR[:\fIcores\fR[:\fIthreads\fR]]>
Request a specific allocation of resources with details as to the
number and type of computational resources within a cluster:
number of sockets (or physical processors) per node,
cores per socket, and threads per core.
The total amount of resources being requested is the product of all of
the terms.
Each value specified is considered a minimum.
An asterisk (*) can be used as a placeholder indicating that all available
resources of that type are to be utilized.
As with nodes, the individual levels can also be specified in separate
options if desired:
.nf
    \fB\-\-sockets\-per\-node\fR=<\fIsockets\fR>
    \fB\-\-cores\-per\-socket\fR=<\fIcores\fR>
    \fB\-\-threads\-per\-core\fR=<\fIthreads\fR>
.fi
If task/affinity plugin is enabled, then specifying an allocation in this
manner also sets a default \fB\-\-cpu_bind\fR option of \fIthreads\fR
if the \fB\-B\fR option specifies a thread count, otherwise an option of
\fIcores\fR if a core count is specified, otherwise an option of \fIsockets\fR.
If SelectType is configured to select/cons_res, it must have a parameter of
CR_Core, CR_Core_Memory, CR_Socket, or CR_Socket_Memory for this option
to be honored.
This option is not supported on BlueGene systems (select/bluegene plugin
is configured).
If not specified, the scontrol show job will display 'ReqS:C:T=*:*:*'.

.TP
\fB\-\-begin\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Submit the batch script to the SLURM controller immediately, like normal, but
tell the controller to defer the allocation of the job until the specified time.

Time may be of the form \fIHH:MM:SS\fR to run a job at
a specific time of day (seconds are optional).
(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)
You may also specify \fImidnight\fR, \fInoon\fR, or
\fIteatime\fR (4pm) and you can have a time\-of\-day suffixed
with \fIAM\fR or \fIPM\fR for running in the morning or the evening.
You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying
a date of the form \fIMMDDYY\fR or \fIMM/DD/YY\fR
\fIYYYY\-MM\-DD\fR. Combine date and time using the following
format \fIYYYY\-MM\-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]\fR. You can also
give times like \fInow + count time\-units\fR, where the time\-units
can be \fIseconds\fR (default), \fIminutes\fR, \fIhours\fR,
\fIdays\fR, or \fIweeks\fR and you can tell SLURM to run
the job today with the keyword \fItoday\fR and to run the
job tomorrow with the keyword \fItomorrow\fR.
The value may be changed after job submission using the
\fBscontrol\fR command.
For example:
.nf
   \-\-begin=16:00
   \-\-begin=now+1hour
   \-\-begin=now+60           (seconds by default)
   \-\-begin=2010\-01\-20T12:34:00
.fi

.RS
.PP
Notes on date/time specifications:
 \- Although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is
allowed by the code, note that the poll time of the SLURM scheduler
is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of the job on the exact
second.  The job will be eligible to start on the next poll
following the specified time. The exact poll interval depends on the
SLURM scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default sched/builtin).
 \- If no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
 \- If a date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current
year is assumed, unless the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has
already passed for that year, in which case the next year is used.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-\-bell\fR
Force salloc to ring the terminal bell when the job allocation is granted
(and only if stdout is a tty).  By default, salloc only rings the bell
if the allocation is pending for more than ten seconds (and only if stdout
is a tty). Also see the option \fB\-\-no\-bell\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-comment\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
An arbitrary comment.

.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint\fR=<\fIlist\fR>
Nodes can have \fBfeatures\fR assigned to them by the SLURM administrator.
Users can specify which of these \fBfeatures\fR are required by their job
using the constraint option.
Only nodes having features matching the job constraints will be used to
satisfy the request.
Multiple constraints may be specified with AND, OR, exclusive OR,
resource counts, etc.
Supported \fbconstraint\fR options include:
.PD 1
.RS
.TP
\fBSingle Name\fR
Only nodes which have the specified feature will be used.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel"\fR
.TP
\fBNode Count\fR
A request can specify the number of nodes needed with some feature
by appending an asterisk and count after the feature name.
For example "\fB\-\-nodes=16 \-\-constraint=graphics*4 ..."\fR
indicates that the job requires 16 nodes at that at least four of those
nodes must have the feature "graphics."
.TP
\fBAND\fR
If only nodes with all of specified features will be used.
The ampersand is used for an AND operator.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel&gpu"\fR
.TP
\fBOR\fR
If only nodes with at least one of specified features will be used.
The vertical bar is used for an OR operator.
For example, \fB\-\-constraint="intel|amd"\fR
.TP
\fBExclusive OR\fR
If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated
nodes, then use the OR operator and enclose the options within square brackets.
For example: "\fB\-\-constraint=[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]"\fR might
be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a single rack of
the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.
.TP
\fBMultiple Counts\fR
Specific counts of multiple resources may be specified by using the AND
operator and enclosing the options within square brackets.
For example: "\fB\-\-constraint=[rack1*2&rack2*4]"\fR might
be used to specify that two nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature
of "rack1" and four nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature
"rack2".
.RE

.TP
\fB\-\-contiguous\fR
If set, then the allocated nodes must form a contiguous set.
Not honored with the \fBtopology/tree\fR or \fBtopology/3d_torus\fR
plugins, both of which can modify the node ordering.

.TP
\fB\-\-cores\-per\-socket\fR=<\fIcores\fR>
Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of
cores per socket.  See additional information under \fB\-B\fR option
above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.

.TP
\fB\-\-cpu_bind\fR=[{\fIquiet,verbose\fR},]\fItype\fR
Bind tasks to CPUs.
Used only when the task/affinity or task/cgroup plugin is enabled.
The configuration parameter \fBTaskPluginParam\fR may override these options.
For example, if \fBTaskPluginParam\fR is configured to bind to cores,
your job will not be able to bind tasks to sockets.
NOTE: To have SLURM always report on the selected CPU binding for all
commands executed in a shell, you can enable verbose mode by setting
the SLURM_CPU_BIND environment variable value to "verbose".

The following informational environment variables are set when \fB\-\-cpu_bind\fR
is in use:
.nf
	SLURM_CPU_BIND_VERBOSE
	SLURM_CPU_BIND_TYPE
	SLURM_CPU_BIND_LIST
.fi

See the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLE\fR section for a more detailed description
of the individual SLURM_CPU_BIND* variables.

When using \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR to run multithreaded tasks, be aware that
CPU binding is inherited from the parent of the process.  This means that
the multithreaded task should either specify or clear the CPU binding
itself to avoid having all threads of the multithreaded task use the same
mask/CPU as the parent.  Alternatively, fat masks (masks which specify more
than one allowed CPU) could be used for the tasks in order to provide
multiple CPUs for the multithreaded tasks.

By default, a job step has access to every CPU allocated to the job.
To ensure that distinct CPUs are allocated to each job step, use the
\fB\-\-exclusive\fR option.

If the job step allocation includes an allocation with a number of
sockets, cores, or threads equal to the number of tasks to be started
then the tasks will by default be bound to the appropriate resources.
Disable this mode of operation by explicitly setting "-\-cpu\-bind=none".

Note that a job step can be allocated different numbers of CPUs on each node
or be allocated CPUs not starting at location zero. Therefore one of the
options which automatically generate the task binding is recommended.
Explicitly specified masks or bindings are only honored when the job step
has been allocated every available CPU on the node.

Binding a task to a NUMA locality domain means to bind the task to the set of
CPUs that belong to the NUMA locality domain or "NUMA node".
If NUMA locality domain options are used on systems with no NUMA support, then
each socket is considered a locality domain.

Supported options include:
.PD 1
.RS
.TP
.B q[uiet]
Quietly bind before task runs (default)
.TP
.B v[erbose]
Verbosely report binding before task runs
.TP
.B no[ne]
Do not bind tasks to CPUs (default)
.TP
.B rank
Automatically bind by task rank.
Task zero is bound to socket (or core or thread) zero, etc.
Not supported unless the entire node is allocated to the job.
.TP
.B map_cpu:<list>
Bind by mapping CPU IDs to tasks as specified
where <list> is <cpuid1>,<cpuid2>,...<cpuidN>.
CPU IDs are interpreted as decimal values unless they are preceded
with '0x' in which case they are interpreted as hexadecimal values.
Not supported unless the entire node is allocated to the job.
.TP
.B mask_cpu:<list>
Bind by setting CPU masks on tasks as specified
where <list> is <mask1>,<mask2>,...<maskN>.
CPU masks are \fBalways\fR interpreted as hexadecimal values but can be
preceded with an optional '0x'.
.TP
.B sockets
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to sockets.
Only the CPUs on the socket which have been allocated to the job will be used.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated sockets
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.
.TP
.B cores
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to cores.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated cores
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.
.TP
.B threads
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to threads.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated threads
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.
.TP
.B ldoms
Automatically generate masks binding tasks to NUMA locality domains.
If the number of tasks differs from the number of allocated locality domains
this can result in sub\-optimal binding.

\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR=<\fIncpus\fR>
Advise the SLURM controller that ensuing job steps will require \fIncpus\fR
number of processors per task.  Without this option, the controller will
just try to allocate one processor per task.

For instance,
consider an application that has 4 tasks, each requiring 3 processors.  If our
cluster is comprised of quad\-processors nodes and we simply ask for
12 processors, the controller might give us only 3 nodes.  However, by using
the \-\-cpus\-per\-task=3 options, the controller knows that each task requires
3 processors on the same node, and the controller will grant an allocation
of 4 nodes, one for each of the 4 tasks.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dependency\fR=<\fIdependency_list\fR>
Defer the start of this job until the specified dependencies have been
satisfied completed.
<\fIdependency_list\fR> is of the form
<\fItype:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]\fR>.
Many jobs can share the same dependency and these jobs may even belong to
different  users. The  value may be changed after job submission using the
scontrol command.
.PD
.RS
.TP
\fBafter:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have begun
execution.
.TP
\fBafterany:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.
.TP
\fBafternotok:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated
in some failed state (non-zero exit code, node failure, timed out, etc).
.TP
\fBafterok:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully
executed (ran to completion with an exit code of zero).
.TP
\fBexpand:job_id\fR
Resources allocated to this job should be used to expand the specified job.
The job to expand must share the same QOS (Quality of Service) and partition.
Gang scheduling of resources in the partition is also not supported.
.TP
\fBsingleton\fR
This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs
sharing the same job name and user have terminated.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-chdir\fR=<\fIpath\fR>

.TP
\fB\-\-exclusive\fR
The job allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs.
This is the opposite of \-\-share, whichever option is seen last
on the command line will be used. The default shared/exclusive
behavior depends on system configuration and the partition's \fBShared\fR
option takes precedence over the job's option.

.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-nodefile\fR=<\fInode file\fR>
Much like \-\-nodelist, but the list is contained in a file of name
\fInode file\fR.  The node names of the list may also span multiple lines
in the file.    Duplicate node names in the file will be ignored.
The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names
will be sorted by SLURM.

.TP
\fB\-\-get\-user\-env\fR[=\fItimeout\fR][\fImode\fR]
This option will load login environment variables for the user specified
in the \fB\-\-uid\fR option.
The environment variables are retrieved by running something of this sort
"su \- <username> \-c /usr/bin/env" and parsing the output.
Be aware that any environment variables already set in salloc's environment
will take precedence over any environment variables in the user's
login environment.
The optional \fItimeout\fR value is in seconds. Default value is 3 seconds.
The optional \fImode\fR value control the "su" options.
With a \fImode\fR value of "S", "su" is executed without the "\-" option.
With a \fImode\fR value of "L", "su" is executed with the "\-" option,
replicating the login environment.
If \fImode\fR not specified, the mode established at SLURM build time
is used.
Example of use include "\-\-get\-user\-env", "\-\-get\-user\-env=10"
"\-\-get\-user\-env=10L", and "\-\-get\-user\-env=S".
NOTE: This option only works if the caller has an
effective uid of "root".
This option was originally created for use by Moab.

.TP
\fB\-\-gid\fR=<\fIgroup\fR>
If \fBsalloc\fR is run as root, and the \fB\-\-gid\fR option is used,
submit the job with \fIgroup\fR's group access permissions.  \fIgroup\fR
may be the group name or the numerical group ID.

.TP
\fB\-\-gres\fR=<\fIlist\fR>
Specifies a comma delimited list of generic consumable resources.
The format of each entry on the list is "name[:count[*cpu]]".
The name is that of the consumable resource.
The count is the number of those resources with a default value of 1.
The specified resources will be allocated to the job on each node
allocated unless "*cpu" is appended, in which case the resources
will be allocated on a per cpu basis.
The available generic consumable resources is configurable by the system
administrator.
A list of available generic consumable resources will be printed and the
command will exit if the option argument is "help".
Examples of use include "\-\-gres=gpus:2*cpu,disk=40G" and "\-\-gres=help".

exit if resources are not available within the
time period specified.
If no argument is given, resources must be available immediately
for the request to succeed.
By default, \fB\-\-immediate\fR is off, and the command
will block until resources become available. Since this option's
argument is optional, for proper parsing the single letter option must
be followed immediately with the value and not include a space between
them. For example "\-I60" and not "\-I 60".

.TP
\fB\-J\fR, \fB\-\-job\-name\fR=<\fIjobname\fR>
Specify a name for the job allocation. The specified name will appear along with
the job id number when querying running jobs on the system.  The default job
name is the name of the "command" specified on the command line.

NOTE: Only valid for user root.

.TP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-kill\-command\fR[=\fIsignal\fR]
salloc always runs a user\-specified command once the allocation is
granted.  salloc will wait indefinitely for that command to exit.
If you specify the \-\-kill\-command option salloc will send a signal to
your command any time that the SLURM controller tells salloc that its job
allocation has been revoked. The job allocation can be revoked for a
couple of reasons: someone used \fBscancel\fR to revoke the allocation,
or the allocation reached its time limit.  If you do not specify a signal
name or number and SLURM is configured to signal the spawned command at job
termination, the default signal is SIGHUP for interactive and SIGTERM for
non\-interactive sessions. Since this option's argument is optional,
for proper parsing the single letter option must be followed
immediately with the value and not include a space between them. For
example "\-K1" and not "\-K 1".

.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-no\-kill\fR
Do not automatically terminate a job of one of the nodes it has been
allocated fails.  The user will assume the responsibilities for fault\-tolerance
should a node fail.  When there is a node failure, any active job steps (usually
MPI jobs) on that node will almost certainly suffer a fatal error, but with
\-\-no\-kill, the job allocation will not be revoked so the user may launch
new job steps on the remaining nodes in their allocation.

By default SLURM terminates the entire job allocation if any node fails in its
range of allocated nodes.

.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-licenses\fR=<\fBlicense\fR>
Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all
nodes of the cluster) which must be allocated to this job.
License names can be followed by a colon and count
(the default count is one).
Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g.
"\-\-licenses=foo:4,bar").

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-distribution\fR=
<\fIblock\fR|\fIcyclic\fR|\fIarbitrary\fR|\fIplane=<options>\fR[:\fIblock\fR|\fIcyclic\fR]>

Specify alternate distribution methods for remote processes.
In salloc, this only sets environment variables that will be used by
subsequent srun requests.
This option controls the assignment of tasks to the nodes on which
resources have been allocated, and the distribution of those resources
to tasks for binding (task affinity). The first distribution
method (before the ":") controls the distribution of resources across
nodes. The optional second distribution method (after the ":")
controls the distribution of resources across sockets within a node.
Note that with select/cons_res, the number of cpus allocated on each
socket and node may be different. Refer to
http://www.schedmd.com/slurmdocs/mc_support.html
for more information on resource allocation, assignment of tasks to
nodes, and binding of tasks to CPUs.
.RS

First distribution method:
.TP
.B block
The block distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such
that consecutive tasks share a node. For example, consider an
allocation of three nodes each with two cpus. A four\-task block
distribution request will distribute those tasks to the nodes with
tasks one and two on the first node, task three on the second node,
and task four on the third node.  Block distribution is the default
behavior if the number of tasks exceeds the number of allocated nodes.
.TP
.B cyclic
The cyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such
that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive nodes (in a
round\-robin fashion). For example, consider an allocation of three
nodes each with two cpus. A four\-task cyclic distribution request
will distribute those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and four on
the first node, task two on the second node, and task three on the
third node.
Note that when SelectType is select/cons_res, the same number of CPUs
may not be allocated on each node. Task distribution will be
round\-robin among all the nodes with CPUs yet to be assigned to tasks.
Cyclic distribution is the default behavior if the number
of tasks is no larger than the number of allocated nodes.
.TP
.B plane
The tasks are distributed in blocks of a specified size.  The options
include a number representing the size of the task block.  This is
followed by an optional specification of the task distribution scheme
within a block of tasks and between the blocks of tasks.  For more
details (including examples and diagrams), please see
.br

.br
and
.br
http://www.schedmd.com/slurmdocs/dist_plane.html
.TP
.B arbitrary
The arbitrary method of distribution will allocate processes in\-order
as listed in file designated by the environment variable
SLURM_HOSTFILE.  If this variable is listed it will over ride any
other method specified.  If not set the method will default to block.
Inside the hostfile must contain at minimum the number of hosts
requested and be one per line or comma separated.  If specifying a
task count (\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-ntasks\fR=<\fInumber\fR>), your tasks
will be laid out on the nodes in the order of the file.
.br
\fBNOTE:\fR The arbitrary distribution option on a job allocation only
controls the nodes to be allocated to the job and not the allocation of
CPUs on those nodes. This option is meant primarily to control a job step's
task layout in an existing job allocation for the srun command.

.TP
Second distribution method:
.TP
.B block
The block distribution method will distribute tasks to sockets such
that consecutive tasks share a socket.

Specify the real memory required per node in MegaBytes.
Default value is \fBDefMemPerNode\fR and the maximum value is

Also see \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR.
\fB\-\-mem\fR and \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR are mutually exclusive.
NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently relies upon the task/cgroup plugin
or enabling of accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data
need not be stored, just collected). In both cases memory use is based upon
the job's Resident Set Size (RSS). A task may exceed the memory limit until
the next periodic accounting sample.

seen using the \fBscontrol show config\fR command.
Note that if the job's \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR value exceeds the configured
\fBMaxMemPerCPU\fR, then the user's limit will be treated as a memory limit
per task; \fB\-\-mem\-per\-cpu\fR will be reduced to a value no larger than

If you want greater control, try running a simple test code with the
options "\-\-cpu_bind=verbose,none \-\-mem_bind=verbose,none" to determine
the specific configuration.

NOTE: To have SLURM always report on the selected memory binding for
all commands executed in a shell, you can enable verbose mode by
setting the SLURM_MEM_BIND environment variable value to "verbose".

The following informational environment variables are set when
\fB\-\-mem_bind\fR is in use:

.nf
	SLURM_MEM_BIND_VERBOSE
	SLURM_MEM_BIND_TYPE
	SLURM_MEM_BIND_LIST
.fi

See the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\fR section for a more detailed description
of the individual SLURM_MEM_BIND* variables.

Supported options include:

.B q[uiet]
quietly bind before task runs (default)
.TP
.B v[erbose]
verbosely report binding before task runs
.TP
.B no[ne]
don't bind tasks to memory (default)
.TP
.B rank
bind by task rank (not recommended)
.TP
.B local
Use memory local to the processor in use
.TP
.B map_mem:<list>
bind by mapping a node's memory to tasks as specified
where <list> is <cpuid1>,<cpuid2>,...<cpuidN>.
CPU IDs are interpreted as decimal values unless they are preceded
with '0x' in which case they interpreted as hexadecimal values
(not recommended)
.TP
.B mask_mem:<list>
bind by setting memory masks on tasks as specified
where <list> is <mask1>,<mask2>,...<maskN>.
memory masks are \fBalways\fR interpreted as hexadecimal values.
Note that masks must be preceded with a '0x' if they don't begin
with [0-9] so they are seen as numerical values by srun.

.TP
\fB\-\-mincpus\fR=<\fIn\fR>
Specify a minimum number of logical cpus/processors per node.

.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-nodes\fR=<\fIminnodes\fR[\-\fImaxnodes\fR]>
Request that a minimum of \fIminnodes\fR nodes be allocated to this job.
A maximum node count may also be specified with \fImaxnodes\fR.
If only one number is specified, this is used as both the minimum and
maximum node count.
The partition's node limits supersede those of the job.
If a job's node limits are outside of the range permitted for its
associated partition, the job will be left in a PENDING state.
This permits possible execution at a later time, when the partition
limit is changed.
If a job node limit exceeds the number of nodes configured in the
partition, the job will be rejected.
Note that the environment
variable \fBSLURM_NNODES\fR will be set to the count of nodes actually
allocated to the job. See the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES \fR section
for more information.  If \fB\-N\fR is not specified, the default
behavior is to allocate enough nodes to satisfy the requirements of
the \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-c\fR options.
The job will be allocated as many nodes as possible within the range specified
and without delaying the initiation of the job.
The node count specification may include a numeric value followed by a suffix
of "k" (multiplies numeric value by 1,024) or "m" (multiplies numeric value by
1,048,576).

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-ntasks\fR=<\fInumber\fR>
salloc does not launch tasks, it requests an allocation of resources and
executed some command. This option advises the SLURM controller that job
steps run within this allocation will launch a maximum of \fInumber\fR
tasks and sufficient resources are allocated to accomplish this.
The default is one task per node, but note
that the \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR option will change this default.

.TP
\fB\-\-network\fR=<\fItype\fR>
Specify the communication protocol to be used.
The interpretation of \fItype\fR is system dependent.
This option is current supported on systems with IBM's Parallel Environment (PE).
See IBM's LoadLeveler job command keyword documentation about the keyword
"network" for more information.
Multiple values may be specified in a comma separated list.
All options are case in\-sensitive.
Supported values include:
.RS
.TP 12
\fBBULK_XFER\fR[=<\fIresources\fR>]
Enable bulk transfer of data using Remote Direct-Memory Access (RDMA).
The optional \fIresources\fR specification is a numeric value which can have
a suffix of "k", "K", "m", "M", "g" or "G" for kilobytes, megabytes or
gigabytes.
NOTE: The \fIresources\fR specification is not supported by the underlying
IBM infrastructure as of Parallel Environment version 2.2 and no value should
be specified at this time.
.TP
\fBCAU\fR=<\fIcount\fR>
Number of Collecitve Accelleration Units (CAU) required.
Applies only to IBM Power7-IH processors.
Default value is zero.
Independent CAU will be allocated for each programming interface (MPI, LAPI, etc.)
.TP
\fBDEVNAME\fR=<\fIname\fR>
Specify the device name to use for communications (e.g. "eth0" or "mlx4_0").
.TP
\fBDEVTYPE\fR=<\fItype\fR>
Specify the device type to use for communications.
The supported values of \fItype\fR are:
"IB" (InfiniBand), "HFI" (P7 Host Fabric Interface),
"IPONLY" (IP-Only interfaces), "HPCE" (HPC Ethernet), and
"KMUX" (Kernel Emulation of HPCE).
The devices allocated to a job must all be of the same type.
The default value depends upon depends upon what hardware is available and in
order of preferences is IPONLY (which is not considered in User Space mode),
HFI, IB, HPCE, and KMUX.
.TP
\fBIMMED\fR =<\fIcount\fR>
Number of immediate send slots per window required.
Applies only to IBM Power7-IH processors.
Default value is zero.
.TP
\fBINSTANCES\fR =<\fIcount\fR>
Specify number of network connections for each task on each network connection.
The default instance count is 1.
.TP
\fBIPV4\fR

.TP
\fBIPV6\fR
Use Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 communications.
.TP
\fBLAPI\fR
Use the LAPI programming interface.
.TP
\fBMPI\fR
Use the MPI programming interface.
MPI is the default interface.
.TP
\fBPAMI\fR
Use the PAMI programming interface.

Some examples of network specifications:
.TP
\fBInstances=2,US,MPI,SN_ALL\fR
Create two user space connections for MPI communications on every switch
network for each task.
.TP
\fBUS,MPI,Instances=3,Devtype=IB\fR
Create three user space connections for MPI communications on every InfiniBand
network for each task.
.TP
\fBIPV4,LAPI,SN_Single\fR
Create a IP version 4 connection for LAPI communications on one switch network
for each task.
.TP
\fBInstances=2,US,LAPI,MPI\fR
Create two user space connections each for LAPI and MPI communcations on every
switch network for each task. Note that SN_ALL is the default option so every
switch network is used. Also note that Instances=2 specifies that two
connections are established for each protocol (LAPI and MPI) and each task.
If there are two networks and four tasks on the node then a total
of 32 connections are estabhished (2 instances x 2 protocols x 2 networks x
4 tasks).

.TP
\fB\-\-nice\fR[=\fIadjustment\fR]
Run the job with an adjusted scheduling priority within SLURM.
With no adjustment value the scheduling priority is decreased
by 100. The adjustment range is from \-10000 (highest priority)
to 10000 (lowest priority). Only privileged users can specify
a negative adjustment. NOTE: This option is presently
ignored if \fISchedulerType=sched/wiki\fR or
\fISchedulerType=sched/wiki2\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-core\fR=<\fIntasks\fR>
Request the maximum \fIntasks\fR be invoked on each core.
Meant to be used with the \fB\-\-ntasks\fR option.
Related to \fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-node\fR except at the core level
instead of the node level.  Masks will automatically be generated
to bind the tasks to specific core unless \fB\-\-cpu_bind=none\fR
is specified.
NOTE: This option is not supported unless
\fISelectTypeParameters=CR_Core\fR or
\fISelectTypeParameters=CR_Core_Memory\fR is configured.

.TP
\fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-socket\fR=<\fIntasks\fR>
Request the maximum \fIntasks\fR be invoked on each socket.
Meant to be used with the \fB\-\-ntasks\fR option.
Related to \fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-node\fR except at the socket level
instead of the node level.  Masks will automatically be generated
to bind the tasks to specific sockets unless \fB\-\-cpu_bind=none\fR
is specified.
NOTE: This option is not supported unless
\fISelectTypeParameters=CR_Socket\fR or
\fISelectTypeParameters=CR_Socket_Memory\fR is configured.

.TP
\fB\-\-ntasks\-per\-node\fR=<\fIntasks\fR>
Request the maximum \fIntasks\fR be invoked on each node.
Meant to be used with the \fB\-\-nodes\fR option.
This is related to \fB\-\-cpus\-per\-task\fR=\fIncpus\fR,
but does not require knowledge of the actual number of cpus on
each node.  In some cases, it is more convenient to be able to
request that no more than a specific number of tasks be invoked
on each node.  Examples of this include submitting
a hybrid MPI/OpenMP app where only one MPI "task/rank" should be
assigned to each node while allowing the OpenMP portion to utilize
all of the parallelism present in the node, or submitting a single
setup/cleanup/monitoring job to each node of a pre\-existing
allocation as one step in a larger job script.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-bell\fR
Silence salloc's use of the terminal bell. Also see the option \fB\-\-bell\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-shell\fR
immediately exit after allocating resources, without running a
command. However, the SLURM job will still be created and will remain
active and will own the allocated resources as long as it is active.
You will have a SLURM job id with no associated processes or
tasks. You can submit \fBsrun\fR commands against this resource allocation,
if you specify the \fB\-\-jobid=\fR option with the job id of this SLURM job.
Or, this can be used to temporarily reserve a set of resources so that
other jobs cannot use them for some period of time.  (Note that the
SLURM job is subject to the normal constraints on jobs, including time
limits, so that eventually the job will terminate and the resources
will be freed, or you can terminate the job manually using the
\fBscancel\fR command.)

.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-overcommit\fR
Overcommit resources.  Normally, \fBsalloc\fR will allocate one task
per processor.  By specifying \fB\-\-overcommit\fR you are explicitly
allowing more than one task per processor.  However no more than
\fBMAX_TASKS_PER_NODE\fR tasks are permitted to execute per node.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partition\fR=<\fIpartition_names\fR>
Request a specific partition for the resource allocation.  If not specified,
the default behavior is to allow the slurm controller to select the default
partition as designated by the system administrator. If the job can use more
than one partition, specify their names in a comma separate list and the one
offering earliest initiation will be used.

.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress informational messages from salloc. Errors will still be displayed.

.TP
\fB\-\-qos\fR=<\fIqos\fR>
Request a quality of service for the job.  QOS values can be defined
for each user/cluster/account association in the SLURM database.
Users will be limited to their association's defined set of qos's when
the SLURM configuration parameter, AccountingStorageEnforce, includes
"qos" in it's definition.

.TP
\fB\-\-reservation\fR=<\fIname\fR>
Allocate resources for the job from the named reservation.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-share\fR
The job allocation can share nodes with other running jobs.
This is the opposite of \-\-exclusive, whichever option is seen last
on the command line will be used. The default shared/exclusive
behavior depends on system configuration and the partition's \fBShared\fR
option takes precedence over the job's option.
This option may result the allocation being granted sooner than if the \-\-share
option was not set and allow higher system utilization, but application
performance will likely suffer due to competition for resources within a node.

.TP
\fB\-\-signal\fR=<\fIsig_num\fR>[@<\fIsig_time\fR>]
When a job is within \fIsig_time\fR seconds of its end time,
send it the signal \fIsig_num\fR.
Due to the resolution of event handling by SLURM, the signal may
be sent up to 60 seconds earlier than specified.
\fIsig_num\fR may either be a signal number or name (e.g. "10" or "USR1").
\fIsig_time\fR must have integer value between zero and 65535.
By default, no signal is sent before the job's end time.
If a \fIsig_num\fR is specified without any \fIsig_time\fR,
the default time will be 60 seconds.

.TP
\fB\-\-sockets\-per\-node\fR=<\fIsockets\fR>
Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of
sockets.  See additional information under \fB\-B\fR option above when
task/affinity plugin is enabled.

.TP
\fB\-\-switches\fR=<\fIcount\fR>[@<\fImax\-time\fR>]
When a tree topology is used, this defines the maximum count of switches
desired for the job allocation and optionally the maximum time to wait
for that number of switches. If SLURM finds an allocation containing more
switches than the count specified, the job remains pending until it either finds
an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires.
It there is no switch count limit, there is no delay in starting the job.
Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds",
"hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and
"days\-hours:minutes:seconds".
The job's maximum time delay may be limited by the system administrator using
the \fBSchedulerParameters\fR configuration parameter with the
\fBmax_switch_wait\fR parameter option.
The default max\-time is the max_switch_wait SchedulerParameter.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Set a limit on the total run time of the job allocation.  If the
requested time limit exceeds the partition's time limit, the job will
be left in a PENDING state (possibly indefinitely).  The default time
limit is the partition's default time limit.  When the time limit is reached,
each task in each job step is sent SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL.  The
interval between signals is specified by the SLURM configuration
parameter \fBKillWait\fR.  A time limit of zero requests that no time
limit be imposed.  Acceptable time formats include "minutes",
"minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours",
"days\-hours:minutes" and "days\-hours:minutes:seconds".

.TP
\fB\-\-threads\-per\-core\fR=<\fIthreads\fR>
Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of
threads per core.  NOTE: "Threads" refers to the number of processing units on
each core rather than the number of appliation tasks to be launched per core.
See additional information under \fB\-B\fR option above when task/affinity
plugin is enabled.

.TP
\fB\-\-time\-min\fR=<\fItime\fR>
Set a minimum time limit on the job allocation.
If specified, the job may have it's \fB\-\-time\fR limit lowered to a value
no lower than \fB\-\-time\-min\fR if doing so permits the job to begin
execution earlier than otherwise possible.
The job's time limit will not be changed after the job is allocated resources.
This is performed by a backfill scheduling algorithm to allocate resources
otherwise reserved for higher priority jobs.
Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds",
"hours:minutes:seconds", "days\-hours", "days\-hours:minutes" and
"days\-hours:minutes:seconds".

.TP
\fB\-\-tmp\fR=<\fIMB\fR>
Specify a minimum amount of temporary disk space.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-usage\fR
Display brief help message and exit.

.TP
\fB\-\-uid\fR=<\fIuser\fR>
Attempt to submit and/or run a job as \fIuser\fR instead of the
invoking user id. The invoking user's credentials will be used
to check access permissions for the target partition. User root
may use this option to run jobs as a normal user in a RootOnly
partition for example. If run as root, \fBsalloc\fR will drop
its permissions to the uid specified after node allocation is
successful. \fIuser\fR may be the user name or numerical user ID.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information and exit.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase the verbosity of salloc's informational messages.  Multiple

.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-nodelist\fR=<\fInode name list\fR>
Request a specific list of node names.  The list may be specified as a
comma\-separated list of node names, or a range of node names
(e.g. mynode[1\-5,7,...]).  Duplicate node names in the list will be ignored.
The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names
will be sorted by SLURM.

.TP
\fB\-\-wait\-all\-nodes\fR=<\fIvalue\fR>

By default the job will begin execution as soon as the allocation is made.
.RS

\fB\-\-cnload\-image\fR=<\fIpath\fR>
Path to compute node image for bluegene block.  BGP only.
Default from \fIblugene.conf\fR if not set.

.TP
\fB\-\-conn\-type\fR=<\fItype\fR>
Require the block connection type to be of a certain type.
On Blue Gene the acceptable of \fItype\fR are MESH, TORUS and NAV.
If NAV, or if not set, then SLURM will try to fit a what the
DefaultConnType is set to in the bluegene.conf if that isn't set the
default is TORUS.
You should not normally set this option.
If running on a BGP system and wanting to run in HTC mode (only for 1
midplane and below).  You can use HTC_S for SMP, HTC_D for Dual, HTC_V
for virtual node mode, and HTC_L for Linux mode.
For systems that allow a different connection type per dimension you
can supply a comma separated list of connection types may be specified, one for
each dimension (i.e. M,T,T,T will give you a torus connection is all
dimensions expect the first).

.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-geometry\fR=<\fIXxYxZ\fR> | <\fIAxXxYxZ\fR>
Specify the geometry requirements for the job. On BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P
systems there are three numbers giving dimensions in the X, Y and Z directions,
while on BlueGene/Q systems there are four numbers giving dimensions in the
A, X, Y and Z directions and can not be used to allocate sub-blocks.
For example "\-\-geometry=1x2x3x4", specifies a block of nodes having
1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 nodes (actually midplanes on BlueGene).

.SH "SIGNALS"
.LP
While salloc is waiting for a PENDING job allocation, most signals will cause
salloc to revoke the allocation request and exit.

However if the allocation has been granted and salloc has already started the
specified command, then salloc will ignore most signals.
salloc will not exit or release the allocation until the command exits.
One notable exception is SIGHUP. A SIGHUP signal will cause salloc to
release the allocation and exit without waiting for the command to finish.
Another exception is SIGTERM, which will be forwarded to the spawned process.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
