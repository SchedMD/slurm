.TH SACCTMGR "1" "April 2009" "sacctmgr 2.0" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
sacctmgr \- Used to view and modify Slurm account information.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacctmgr\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsacctmgr\fR is used to view or modify Slurm account information.
The account information is maintained within a database with the interface
being provided by \fBslurmdbd\fR (Slurm Database daemon).
This database can serve as a central storehouse of user and
computer information for multiple computers at a single site.
Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters
that form what is referred to as an \fIassociation\fR.
These parameters are \fIuser\fR, \fIcluster\fR, \fIpartition\fR, and
\fIaccount\fR. \fIuser\fR is the login name.
\fIcluster\fR is the name of a Slurm managed cluster as specified by
the \fIClusterName\fR parameter in the \fIslurm.conf\fR configuration file.
\fIpartition\fR is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.
\fIaccount\fR is the bank account for a job.
The intended mode of operation is to initiate the \fBsacctmgr\fR command,
add, delete, modify, and/or list \fIassociation\fR records then
commit the changes and exit.

.TP "7"
\f3Note: \fP\c
The content's of SLURM's database are maintained in lower case. This may
result in some \f3sacctmgr\fP output differing from that of other SLURM

\fINoReserve\fP
If this flag is set and backfill scheduling is used, jobs using this QOS will
not reserve resources in the backfill schedule's  map of resources allocated
through time. This flag is intended for use with a QOS that may be preempted
by jobs associated with all other QOS (e.g use with a "standby" QOS). If the
allocated is used with a QOS which can not be preempted by all other QOS, it
could result in starvation of larger jobs.

override the requested partition's MaxNodes limit.

.SH "FLAT FILE DUMP AND LOAD"
sacctmgr has the capability to load and dump SLURM association data to and
from a file.  This method can easily add a new cluster or copy an
existing clusters associations into a new cluster with similar
accounts. Each file contains SLURM association data for a single
cluster.  Comments can be put into the file with the # character.
Each line of information must begin with one of the four titles; \fBCluster, Parent, Account or
User\fP. Following the title is a space, dash, space, entity value,
then specifications. Specifications are colon separated.  If any
variable such as Organization has a space in it, surround the name with
single or double quotes.

To create a file of associations one can run

> sacctmgr dump tux file=tux.cfg
.br
(file=tux.cfg is optional)

To load a previously created file you can run

> sacctmgr load file=tux.cfg

Other options for load are \-

clean \- delete what was already there and start from scratch with this
information.
.br
Cluster= \- specify a different name for the cluster than that which is
in the file.

Quick explanation how the file works.

Since the associations in the system follow a hierarchy, so does the
file.  Anything that is a parent needs to be defined before any
children.  The only exception is the understood 'root' account.  This
is always a default for any cluster and does not need to be defined.

To edit/create a file start with a cluster line for the new cluster

\fBCluster\ \-\ cluster_name:MaxNodesPerJob=15\fP

Anything included on this line will be the defaults for all
associations on this cluster.  These options are as follows...

.SH "ARCHIVE FUNCTIONALITY"
Sacctmgr has the capability to archive to a flatfile and or load that
data if needed later.  The archiving is usually done by the slurmdbd
and it is highly recommended you only do it through sacctmgr if you
completely understand what you are doing.  For slurmdbd options see
"man slurmdbd" for more information.
Loading data into the database can be done from these files to either
view old data or regenerate rolled up data.

These are the options for both dump and load of archive information.

.TP
\fIPurgeJobAfter=\fP
Purge job records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a

want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
.TP
\fIPurgeSuspendAfter=\fP
Purge job suspend records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a

When modifying an object placing the key words 'set' and the
optional 'where' is critical to perform correctly below are examples to
produce correct results.  As a rule of thumb anything you put in front
of the set will be used as a quantifier.  If you want to put a
quantifier after the key word 'set' you should use the key
word 'where'.
.br

.br
wrong> sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 cluster=tux
.br

.br
This will produce an error as the above line reads modify user adam
set fairshare=10 and cluster=tux.
.br

.br
right> sacctmgr modify user name=adam cluster=tux set fairshare=10
.br
right> sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 where cluster=tux
.br

.br
When changing qos for something only use the '=' operator when wanting
to explicitly set the qos to something.  In most cases you will want
to use the '+=' or '\-=' operator to either add to or remove from the
existing qos already in place.
.br

.br
If a user already has qos of normal,standby for a parent or it was
explicitly set you should use qos+=expedite to add this to the list in
this fashion.
.br

.br
> sacctmgr modify user name=adam set qos+=expedite
.br

.br
If you are looking to only add the qos expedite to only a certain
account and or cluster you can do that by specifying them in the
sacctmgr line.
