.TH sacctmgr "1" "Slurm Commands" "July 2025" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sacctmgr \- Used to view and modify Slurm account information.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacctmgr\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsacctmgr\fR is used to view or modify Slurm account information.
The account information is maintained within a database with the interface
being provided by \fBslurmdbd\fR (Slurm Database daemon).
This database can serve as a central storehouse of user and
computer information for multiple computers at a single site.
Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters
that form what is referred to as an \fIassociation\fR.
These parameters are \fIuser\fR, \fIcluster\fR, \fIpartition\fR, and
\fIaccount\fR. \fIuser\fR is the login name.
\fIcluster\fR is the name of a Slurm managed cluster as specified by
the \fIClusterName\fR parameter in the \fIslurm.conf\fR configuration file.
\fIpartition\fR is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.
\fIaccount\fR is the bank account for a job.
The intended mode of operation is to initiate the \fBsacctmgr\fR command,
add, delete, modify, and/or list \fIassociation\fR records then
commit the changes and exit.

\fBNOTE\fR: The contents of Slurm's database are maintained in lower case.
This may result in some \f3sacctmgr\fP output differing from that of other
Slurm commands.

.IP

.TP
\fBassociation\fR
The entity used to group information consisting of four parameters:
\fBaccount\fR, \fBcluster\fR, \fBpartition\fR (optional), and \fBuser\fR.
Used only with the \fBlist\fR or \fBshow\fR command. Add, modify, and
delete should be done to a user, account or cluster entity, which will
in turn update the underlying associations. Modification of attributes like
limits is allowed for an association but not a modification of the four
core attributes of an association. You cannot change the partition setting
(or set one if it has not been set) for an existing association. Instead,
you will need to create a new association with the partition included. You
can either keep the previous association with no partition defined, or delete
it. Note that these newly added associations are unique entities and any
existing usage information will not be carried over to the new association.
.IP

.TP
\fBcluster\fR
The \fBClusterName\fR parameter in the \fBslurm.conf\fR configuration
file, used to differentiate accounts on different machines.
.IP

.TP
\fBconfiguration\fR
Used only with the \fBlist\fR or \fBshow\fR command to report current
system configuration.
.IP

.TP
\fBcoordinator\fR
A special privileged user, usually an account manager, that can
add users or sub\-accounts to the account they are coordinator over.
This should be a trusted person since they can change limits on
account and user associations, as well as cancel, requeue or reassign
accounts of jobs inside their realm.
.IP

.TP
\fBevent\fR
Events like downed or drained nodes on clusters. Note that this does not
include transitory states like DRAINING.
.IP

.TP
\fBfederation\fR
A group of clusters that work together to schedule jobs.
.IP

.TP
\fBjob\fR
Used to modify specific fields of a job: Derived Exit Code, Comment,
AdminComment, Extra, SystemComment, or WCKey.
.IP

.TP
\fBproblem\fR
Use with \fBshow\fR or \fBlist\fR to display entity problems.
.IP

.TP

Quality of Service.
.IP

.TP
\fBreservation\fR
A collection of resources set apart for use by a particular account, user
or group of users for a given period of time.
.IP

.TP
\fBresource\fR
Software resources for the system. Those are software licenses shared
among clusters.
.IP

.TP
\fBRunawayJobs\fR
Used only with the \fBlist\fR or \fBshow\fR command to report current
jobs that have been orphaned on the local cluster and are now
runaway. If there are jobs in this state it will also give you an
option to "fix" them.
This sets the end time for each job to the latest of the job's start, eligible,
and submit times, and sets the state to completed. Once corrected, this triggers
the SlurmDBD to recalculate the usage from before the earliest submit time of
all the runaway jobs. \fBNOTE\fR: This could take a long time and sreport
may not return data until the recalculation is completed.
\fBNOTE\fR: You must have an \fBAdminLevel\fR of at least \fBOperator\fR to perform
this.
.IP

.TP
\fBstats\fR
Used with \fBlist\fR or \fBshow\fR command to view server statistics.
Accepts optional argument of \fBave_time\fR or \fBtotal_time\fR to sort on those
fields. By default, sorts on increasing RPC count field.
.IP

.TP
\fBtransaction\fR
List of transactions that have occurred during a given time period.
.IP

.TP
\fBtres\fR
Used with \fBlist\fR or \fBshow\fR command to view a list of Trackable
RESources configured on the system.
.IP

.TP
\fBuser\fR
The login name. Usernames are case\-insensitive (forced to lowercase) unless
the \fBPreserveCaseUser\fR option has been set in the SlurmDBD configuration
file.
.IP

.TP
\fBwckeys\fR
Workload  Characterization  Key. An arbitrary  string  for  grouping orthogonal accounts.
.IP

.SH "GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR ASSOCIATION BASED ENTITIES"
\fBNOTE\fR: The group limits (GrpJobs, GrpTRES, etc.) are tested when a job is
being considered for being allocated resources.
If starting a job would cause any of its group limit to be exceeded,
that job will not be considered for scheduling even if that job might preempt
other jobs which would release sufficient group resources for the pending
job to be initiated.

.TP

association of a cluster. So even though it may appear in sacctmgr
output, it will not be enforced.

\fBNOTE\fR: This limit only applies when using the Priority Multifactor
plugin. The time is decayed using the value of PriorityDecayHalfLife
or PriorityUsageResetPeriod as set in the slurm.conf. When this limit

.TP
\fBPreemptExemptTime\fR
Specifies a minimum run time for jobs in this QOS before they are considered for
preemption. This QOS option takes precedence over the global
\fIPreemptExemptTime\fP. This is only honored for \fBPreemptMode=REQUEUE\fR
and \fBPreemptMode=CANCEL\fR.
.br
Setting to \-1 disables the option, allowing another
QOS or the global option to take effect. Setting to 0 indicates no minimum run
time and supersedes the lower priority QOS (see \fIOverPartQOS\fP) and/or the
global option in slurm.conf.
.IP

.TP
\fBPreemptMode\fR
Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling for this QOS
when the cluster's \fIPreemptType\fR is set to \fIpreempt/qos\fR.
This QOS\-specific \fBPreemptMode\fR will override the cluster\-wide
\fBPreemptMode\fR for this QOS. Unsetting the QOS specific \fBPreemptMode\fR,
by specifying "OFF", "" or "Cluster", makes it use the default cluster\-wide
\fBPreemptMode\fR.
.br
The \fBGANG\fR option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of
whether preemption is enabled (i.e. independent of the \fBPreemptType\fR
setting). It can be specified in addition to a \fBPreemptMode\fR setting with
the two options comma\-separated (e.g. \fBPreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG\fR).
.br
See <https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html> and
<https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html> for more details.

\fBNOTE\fR:
For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs,
not partial nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more
other jobs, the whole nodes for those preempted jobs are reserved for the
preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer resources than that.
These reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may
preempt more resources during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR:
For heterogeneous job to be considered for preemption all components
must be eligible for preemption. When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted
the first identified component of the job with the highest order PreemptMode
(\fBSUSPEND\fR (highest), \fBREQUEUE\fR, \fBCANCEL\fR (lowest)) will be
used to set the PreemptMode for all components. The \fBGraceTime\fR and user
warning signal for each component of the heterogeneous job remain unique.
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
.IP
.RS
.TP 12
\fBOFF\fR
Is the default value and disables job preemption and gang scheduling.
It is only compatible with \fBPreemptType=preempt/none\fR at a global level.
.IP

.TP
\fBCANCEL\fR
The preempted job will be cancelled.
.IP

.TP
\fBGANG\fR
Enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and
allows the resuming of suspended jobs.
Configure the \fIOverSubscribe\fR setting to \fIFORCE\fR for all partitions
in which time\-slicing is to take place.
Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so
if you only want time\-slicing by \fBOverSubscribe\fR, without any preemption,
then configuring partitions with overlapping nodes is not recommended.
Time\-slicing won't happen between jobs on different partitions.

\fBNOTE\fR:
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
.IP

.TP
\fBREQUEUE\fR
Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or canceling them.
For jobs to be requeued they must have the \-\-requeue sbatch option set
or the cluster wide JobRequeue parameter in slurm.conf must be set to \fB1\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBSUSPEND\fR
The preempted jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume
them. Therefore the \fBSUSPEND\fR preemption mode always needs the \fBGANG\fR
option to be specified at the cluster level. Also, because the suspended jobs
will still use memory on the allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to track
memory resources to be able to suspend jobs.
.br
If \fBPreemptType=preempt/qos\fR is configured and if the preempted job(s) and
the preemptor job are on the same partition, then they will share resources with
the Gang scheduler (time\-slicing). If not (i.e. if the preemptees and preemptor
are on different partitions) then the preempted jobs will remain suspended until
the preemptor ends.

\fBNOTE\fR: Suspended jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not
be able to preempt to gain access to GRES.
.IP

.TP
\fBWITHIN\fR
Allows for preemption between jobs sharing the same qos. By default,

\fBPriority\fR
QOS priority factor to be used by the priority/multifactor plugin.
Unset by default, indicating that no extra priority is granted.

\fIPreempt\fP instead.
.IP

.TP
\fBRawUsage\fR=<\fIvalue\fR>
This allows an administrator to set the raw usage accrued to a QOS. Specifying
a value of 0 (zero) will reset the raw usage. This is a settable specification
only \- it cannot be used as a filter to list accounts.
.IP

.TP
\fBUsageFactor\fR
A float that is factored into a job's TRES usage (e.g. RawUsage, TRESMins,
TRESRunMins). For example, if the usagefactor was 2, for every TRESBillingUnit
second a job ran it would count for 2. If the usagefactor was .5, every second
would only count for half of the time. A setting of 0 would add no timed usage
from the job.

The usage factor only applies to the job's QOS and not the partition QOS.

If the \fIUsageFactorSafe\fR flag \fIis\fR set and
\fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR includes \fISafe\fR, jobs will only be started if
they can run to completion with the \fIUsageFactor\fR applied, and won't be
killed due to limits.

If the \fIUsageFactorSafe\fR flag is \fInot\fR set and
\fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR includes \fISafe\fR, jobs will be started if
they can run to completion without the \fIUsageFactor\fR applied,
and won't be killed due to limits.

If the \fIUsageFactorSafe\fR flag is \fInot\fR set and
\fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR does not include \fISafe\fR, jobs will be
scheduled as long as the limits are not reached, but could be killed due to
limits.

See \fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR in slurm.conf man page.

Default is 1. To clear an existing value, set a new value of \-1.
.IP

.TP
\fBUsageThreshold\fR
A float representing the lowest fairshare of an association allowed
to run a job. If an association falls below this threshold and has
pending jobs or submits new jobs those jobs will be held until the
usage goes back above the threshold. Use \fIsshare\fP to see current
shares on the system.

.LP
Users can be created, modified, and deleted with sacctmgr. These
options allow you to set the corresponding attributes or filter on them
when querying for Users.

.LP
It is important to recognize the difference between a User and an Association.
There is a User entity that exists for each unique username. However, there
can be multiple User Associations for the same User. The combination of a
Cluster, Account, User, and optionally a Partition constitute a User
Association. When adding an existing User to another Account, you are creating
an additional User Association rather than modifying an existing User.

.SH "LIST/SHOW TRES"

.LP
Fields you can display when viewing TRES records by using the
\fIformat=\fR option. The default format is:
.br
Type,Name,ID

.TP
\fBID\fR
The identification number of the trackable resource as it appears
in the database.
.IP

.TP
\fBName\fR
The name of the trackable resource. This option is required for
TRES types BB (Burst buffer), GRES, and License. Types CPU, Energy,
Memory, and Node do not have Names. For example if GRES is the
type then name is the denomination of the GRES itself e.g. GPU.
.IP

.TP
\fBType\fR
The type of the trackable resource. Current types are BB (Burst
buffer), CPU, Energy, GRES, License, Memory, and Node.
.IP

.SH "TRES information"
Trackable RESources (TRES) are used in many QOS or Association limits
(GrpTRES* / MaxTRES*). When setting limits, one or more comma\-separated
"TRES=value" assignments can be specified.

Each TRES can be one of the Slurm defaults (e.g., \fIcpu\fR, \fImem\fR,
\fInode\fR), or any defined generic resource. You can see the list of available
resources by running \fBsacctmgr show tres\fR.

Each TRES has a different limit, e.g., "GrpTRES=cpu=16,mem=32G" would
establish 2 different limits: one for 16 CPUs and another for 32 GB of memory.

Setting a new value for a TRES type does not affect any other TRES types that
were previously specified. For example, on the same entity as above, a
subsequent assignment of "GrpTRES=gres/gpu=2" will result in
"GrpTRES=cpu=16,mem=32G,gres/gpu=2" applying to that entity.

To remove a limit, assign \-1 to the TRES type whose limit should be removed,
e.g., "GrpTRESMins=cpu=\-1" would remove only the cpu TRES limit, resulting in
"GrpTRES=mem=32G,gres/gpu=2" on that entity.

\fBNOTE\fR: When dealing with Memory as a TRES the default units are MB. A
suffix of G, T, or P can be added to specify a limit in larger units.

\fBNOTE\fR: The Billing TRES is calculated from a partition's
TRESBillingWeights. It is temporarily calculated during scheduling for each
partition to enforce billing TRES limits. The final Billing TRES value is
calculated after the job has been allocated resources and can be seen in
\fBscontrol show jobs\fR and \fBsacct\fR output.

.SH "GLOBAL FORMAT OPTION"
When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a
%NUMBER afterwards to specify how many characters should be printed.

e.g. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right
justified. A \-30 will print 30 characters left justified.

.SH "FLAT FILE DUMP AND LOAD"
sacctmgr has the capability to load and dump Slurm association data to and
from a file. This method can easily add a new cluster or copy an
existing cluster's associations into a new cluster with similar
accounts. Each file contains Slurm association data for a single
cluster. Be aware that QOS information is not currently included in the
information that can be dumped to a file. QOS information can be retrieved
and loaded using the REST API or it must be transferred to a new cluster
manually. Comments can be put into the file with the # character.
Each line of information must begin with one of the four titles; \fBCluster\fP,
\fBParent\fP, \fBAccount\fP or \fBUser\fP. Following the title is a space,
dash, space, entity value, then specifications. Specifications are
colon\-separated. If any variable, such as an Organization name, has a space in
it, surround the name with single or double quotes.

.P
sacctmgr dump/load must be run as a Slurm administrator or root. If using
sacctmgr load on a database without any associations, it must be run as root
(because there aren't any users in the database yet).

.SS dump
Dump cluster associations from the database into a file. If no file is given
then one will be generated, using the cluster name for the file name. That
file will be created in the current working directory.

.P
To create a file with the association information you can run:

.nf

include 'account', 'qos' and 'user'. If you would like to remove accounts, qos,

\fIclean=account,qos,user\fR.

A user's account can not be changed directly. A new association needs to be
created for the user with the new account. Then the association with the old
account can be deleted.

When modifying an object placing the key words 'set' and the
optional 'where' is critical to perform correctly below are examples to
produce correct results. As a rule of thumb anything you put in front
of the set will be used as a quantifier. If you want to put a
quantifier after the key word 'set' you should use the key
word 'where'. The following is wrong:

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 cluster=tux
.fi

This will produce an error as the above line reads modify user adam
set fairshare=10 and cluster=tux. Either of the following is correct:

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam cluster=tux set fairshare=10
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 where cluster=tux
.fi

When changing qos for something only use the '=' operator when wanting
to explicitly set the qos to something. In most cases you will want
to use the '+=' or '\-=' operator to either add to or remove from the
existing qos already in place.

If a user already has qos of normal,standby for a parent or it was
explicitly set you should use qos+=expedite to add this to the list in
this fashion.

If you are looking to only add the qos expedite to only a certain
account and or cluster you can do that by specifying them in the
sacctmgr line.

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set qos+=expedite
.fi

or

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam acct=this cluster=tux set qos+=expedite
.fi

Let's give an example how to add QOS to user accounts.
List all available QOSs in the cluster.

.nf
$ sacctmgr show qos format=name
       Name
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
     normal
   expedite
.fi

List all the associations in the cluster.

.nf
$ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
   Cluster     Account                  QOS
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
     zebra        root               normal

     zebra          g1               normal

Add the QOS expedite to account G1 and display the result.
Using the operator += the QOS will be added together
with the  existing QOS to this account.

     zebra        root               normal
     zebra           g               normal
     zebra          g1      expedite,normal
.fi

Now set the QOS expedite as the only QOS for the account G and display
the result. Using the operator = that expedite is the only usable
QOS by account G

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify account name=G set qos=expedite
$ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
   Cluster     Account                  QOS
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
     zebra        root               normal
     zebra        root               normal
     zebra           g             expedite
     zebra          g1      expedite,normal
.fi

If a new account is added under the account G it will inherit the
QOS expedite and it will not have access to QOS normal.

.nf
$ sacctmgr add account banana parent=G
$ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
   Cluster     Account                  QOS
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
     zebra        root               normal
     zebra        root               normal
     zebra           g             expedite
     zebra      banana             expedite
     zebra          g1      expedite,normal
.fi
