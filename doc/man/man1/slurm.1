slurm \- SLURM system overview.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system
for large and small Linux clusters. SLURM requires no kernel modifications for
its operation and is relatively self-contained. As a cluster resource manager,
SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive
access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they
can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and
monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes.
Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of
pending work.
Optional plugins can be used for accounting, advanced reservation,
gang scheduling (time sharing for parallel jobs), backfill scheduling,
resource limits by user or bank account,
and sophisticated multifactor job prioritization algorithms.

SLURM has a centralized manager, \fBslurmctld\fR, to monitor resources and
work. There may also be a backup manager to assume those responsibilities in the
event of failure. Each compute server (node) has a \fBslurmd\fR daemon, which
can be compared to a remote shell: it waits for work, executes that work, returns
status, and waits for more work. An optional \fBslurmDBD\fR (SLURM DataBase Daemon)
can be used for accounting purposes and to maintain resource limit information.

Basic user tools include \fBsrun\fR to initiate jobs,
\fBscancel\fR to terminate queued or running jobs, \fBsinfo\fR to report system
status, and \fBsqueue\fR to report the status of jobs. There is also an administrative
tool \fBscontrol\fR available to monitor and/or modify configuration and state
information. APIs are available for all functions.

SLURM configuration is maintained in the \fBslurm.conf\fR file.

Man pages are available for all SLURM commands, daemons, APIs, plus the
\fBslurm.conf\fR file.
Extensive documentation is also available on the internet at
\fB<http://slurm.schedmd.com/>\fR.
