.TH sacct "1" "Slurm Commands" "November 2023" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sacct \- displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the
Slurm job accounting log or Slurm database

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacct\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with Slurm are either logged
in the job accounting log file or saved to the Slurm database, as
configured with the AccountingStorageType parameter.
.PP
The \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting data stored in the job
accounting log file or Slurm database in a variety of forms for your
analysis.  The \f3sacct\fP command displays information on jobs, job
steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output
with the use of the \f3\-\-format=\fP option to specify the fields to
be shown.
.PP
Job records consist of a primary entry for the job as a whole as well as
entries for job steps. The Job Launch page has a more detailed description
of each type of job step.
<https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_launch.html#job_record>
.PP
For the root user, the \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting
data for all users, although there are options to filter the output to
report only the jobs from a specified user or group.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the \f3sacct\fP command limits the display of
job accounting data to jobs that were launched with their own user
identifier (UID) by default.  Data for other users can be displayed
with the \f3\-\-allusers\fP, \f3\-\-user\fP, or \f3\-\-uid\fP options.
.PP
Elapsed time fields are presented as
[days\-]hours:minutes:seconds[.microseconds]. Only 'CPU' fields will
ever have microseconds.
.PP
The default input file is the file named in the
\f3AccountingStorageLoc\fP parameter in slurm.conf.

\fBNOTE\fR: If designated, the slurmdbd.conf option PrivateData may further
restrict the accounting data visible to users which are not
SlurmUser, root, or a user with AdminLevel=Admin. See the
slurmdbd.conf man page for additional details on restricting
access to accounting data.

\fBNOTE\fR: The contents of Slurm's database are maintained in lower case.
This may result in some \f3sacct\fP output differing from that of other Slurm
commands.

\fBNOTE\fR: Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your systems
\f2getrusage (3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP "10"
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-accounts\fR=<\fIaccount_list\fR>
Displays jobs when a comma separated list of accounts are given as the
argument.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-array\fR
Expand job arrays. Display all array tasks on separate lines instead of
displaying groups of array tasks on single lines.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-allclusters\fR
Display jobs ran on all clusters. By default, only jobs ran on the
cluster from where \fBsacct\fR is called are displayed.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-allocations\fR
Only show statistics relevant to the job allocation itself, not taking steps
into consideration.

\fBNOTE\fR: Without including steps, utilization statistics for job
allocation(s) will be reported as zero.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-allusers\fR
Displays all users' jobs when run by user root or if \fBPrivateData\fP is not
configured to \fBjobs\fP.
Otherwise display the current user's jobs
.IP

.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-associations\fR=<\fIassoc_list\fR>
Displays the statistics only for the jobs running under the
association ids specified by the \fBassoc_list\fR operand, which is a
comma\-separated list of association ids.  Space characters are not
allowed in the \fBassoc_list\fR. Default is all associations\&.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-batch\-script\fR
This option will print the batch script of job if the job used one. If the job
didn't have a script 'NONE' is output.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: AccountingStoreFlags=job_script is required for this.
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: Requesting specific job(s) with '\-j' is required for this.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-brief\fR
Displays a brief listing consisting of JobID, State, and ExitCode.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIcluster_list\fR>
Displays the statistics only for the jobs started on the clusters
specified by the \fIcluster_list\fR operand, which is a
comma\-separated list of clusters.  Space characters are not allowed
in the \fIcluster_list\fR.
A value of '\fIall\fR' will query to run on all clusters.
The default is current cluster you are executing the \fBsacct\fR command on or
all clusters in the federation when executed on a federated cluster.
This option implicitly sets the \fB\-\-local\fR option.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-completion\fR
Use job completion data instead of job accounting.  The \fBJobCompType\fR
parameter in the slurm.conf file must be defined to a non\-none option.
Does not support federated cluster information (local data only).
.IP

.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraints\fR=<\fIconstraint_list\fR>
Comma separated list to filter jobs based on what constraints/features the job
requested.  Multiple options will be treated as 'and' not 'or', so the job would
need all constraints specified to be returned not one or the other.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-delimiter\fR=<\fIcharacters\fR>
ASCII characters used to separate the fields when specifying
the \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-P\fR options. The default delimiter
is a '|'. This option is ignored if \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-P\fR options
are not specified.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-duplicates\fR
If Slurm job ids are reset, some job numbers will probably appear more
than once in the accounting log file but refer to different jobs.
Such jobs can be distinguished by the "submit" time stamp in the data
records.
.IP

When data for specific jobs are requested with the \-\-jobs option,
\fBsacct\fR returns the most recent job with that number. This
behavior can be overridden by specifying \-\-duplicates, in which case
all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.
.IP

\fBNOTE\fR: Revoked federated sibling jobs are hidden unless the
\fB\-\-duplicates\fR option is specified.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-endtime\fR=<\fIend_time\fR>
Select jobs in any state before the specified time.  If states are
given with the \-s option return jobs in this state before this period.
See the \fBDEFAULT TIME WINDOW\fR for more details.

Valid time formats are:
.br
HH:MM[:SS][AM|PM]
.br
MMDD[YY][\-HH:MM[:SS]]
.br
MM.DD[.YY][\-HH:MM[:SS]]
.br

.br
\fBNOTE\fR: Requesting specific job(s) with '\-j' is required for this.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Show jobs from the federation if a member of one.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=<\fIfile\fR>
Causes the \f3sacct\fP command to read job accounting data from the
named \f2file\fP instead of the current Slurm job accounting log
file. Only applicable when running the jobcomp/filetxt plugin. Setting this flag
implicitly enables the \-c flag.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-flags\fR=<\fIflag_list\fR>
Comma separated list to filter jobs based on what various ways the jobs were
handled.  Current flags are SchedSubmit, SchedMain, SchedBackfill and
StartReceived. SchedSubmit, SchedMain, SchedBackfill describe the scheduler
that started the job.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR
Comma separated list of fields. (use "\-\-helpformat" for a list of
available fields).

\fBNOTE\fR: When using the format option for listing various fields you can put
a %NUMBER afterwards to specify how many characters should be printed.

e.g. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right
justified.  A %\-30 will print 30 characters left justified.

When set, the SACCT_FORMAT environment variable will override the
default format.  For example:

SACCT_FORMAT="jobid,user,account,cluster"
.IP

.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gid\fR=, \fB\-\-group\fR=<\fIgid_or_group_list\fR>

\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-state\fR=<\fIstate_list\fR>
Selects jobs based on their state during the time period given.
Unless otherwise specified, the start and end time will be the
current time when the \fB\-\-state\fR option is specified and
only currently running jobs can be displayed.
A start and/or end time must be specified to view information about
jobs not currently running.
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for a list of state designators.
Multiple state names may be specified using comma separators. Either the short
or long form of the state name may be used (e.g. \fBCA\fR or \fBCANCELLED\fR)
and the name is case insensitive (i.e. \fRca\fR and \fBCA\fR both work).

\fBNOTE\fR: Note for a job to be selected in the PENDING state it must have
"EligibleTime" in the requested time interval or different from "Unknown". The
"EligibleTime" is displayed by the "scontrol show job" command.  For example
jobs submitted with the "\-\-hold" option will have "EligibleTime=Unknown" as
they are pending indefinitely.

\fBNOTE\fR: When specifying states and no start time is given the default
start time is 'now'.  This is only when \-j is not used.  If \-j is used the
start time will default to 'Epoch'.  In both cases if no end time is given it
will default to 'now'. See the \fBDEFAULT TIME WINDOW\fR for more details.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-timelimit\-max\fR

timelimit_max this will be the minimum timelimit of the range.
Default is no restriction.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-truncate\fR
Truncate time.  So if a job started before \-\-starttime the start time
would be truncated to \-\-starttime.  The same for end time and \-\-endtime.

option.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Display a command usage summary.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-use\-local\-uid\fR
When displaying UID, sacct uses the UID stored in Slurm's accounting database
by default. Use this command to make Slurm use a system call to get the UID
from the username. This option may be useful in an environment with multiple
clusters and one database where the UIDs aren't the same on all clusters.

list of wckey names.  Space characters are not allowed in the
\f2wckey_list\fP. Default is all wckeys\&.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-whole\-hetjob\fR[=yes|no]
When querying and filtering heterogeneous jobs with \fB\-\-jobs\fR, Slurm will
default to retrieving information about all the components of the job if the
het_job_id (leader id) is selected. If a non\-leader heterogeneous job component
id is selected then only that component is retrieved by default. This behavior
can be changed by using this option. If set to 'yes' (or no argument), then
information about all the components will be retrieved no matter which component
is selected in the job filter. If set to 'no' then only the selected
heterogeneous job component(s) will be retrieved, even when selecting the
leader.

Array jobs are in the form:
.IP

\f2ArrayJobID_ArrayTaskID\fP

Heterogeneous jobs are in the form:
.IP

\f2HetJobID+HetJobOffset\fP

When printing job arrays, performance of the command can be measurably improved
for systems with large numbers of jobs when a single job ID is specified. By
default, this field size will be limited to 64 bytes. Use the environment
variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.
.IP

.TP
\f3JobIDRaw\fP
The identification number of the job or job step.  Prints the JobID in the
form \f2JobID[.JobStep]\fP for regular, heterogeneous and array jobs.
.IP

.TP
\f3JobName\fP
The name of the job or job step. The \f3slurm_accounting.log\fP file
is a space delimited file. Because of this if a space is used in the
jobname an underscore is substituted for the space before the record
is written to the accounting file. So when the jobname is displayed
by \f3sacct\fP the jobname that had a space in it will now have an underscore
in place of the space.

than will fit into the current field width (for example, the UID that CANCELLED
a job) the state will be followed by a "+".  You can increase the size of
the displayed state using the "%NUMBER" format modifier described earlier.

\fBNOTE\fR: The RUNNING state will return suspended jobs as well.  In order
to print suspended jobs you must request SUSPENDED at a different call
from RUNNING.

\fBNOTE\fR: The RUNNING state will return any jobs completed (cancelled or
otherwise) in the time period requested as the job was also RUNNING during that
time. If you are only looking for jobs that finished, please choose the
appropriate state(s) without the RUNNING state.
.IP

.TP
\f3Submit\fP
The time the job was submitted. In the same format as \f3End\fP.

\fBNOTE\fR: If a job is requeued, the submit time is reset.  To obtain the

jobs that include multiple job steps. Format is the same as \f3Elapsed\fP.

\fBNOTE\fR: For the steps interrupted by signal (e.g. scancel, job timeout)
TotalCPU provides a measure of the task's parent process and may not include
CPU time of child processes.
This is a result of \f3wait3\fP resource usage (\f3getrusage\fP) internals.
For processes completing in regular way all the descendant processes (forks and
execs) resources are included. However, if the processes are killed the result
may differ between proctrack plugins and end-user applications.
\"Proctrack pgid is significantly different, since it makes use of killpg
\"not kill, which seems to allow better resources usage gathering.

.SH "DEFAULT TIME WINDOW"
.PP
The options \-\-starttime and \-\-endtime define the time window between
which \fBsacct\fR is going to search. For historical and practical
reasons their default values (i.e. the default time window)
depends on other options: \-\-jobs and \-\-state.

Depending on if \-\-jobs and/or \-\-state are specified, the default
values of \fB\-\-starttime\fR  and \fB\-\-endtime\fR options are:

.LP
WITHOUT EITHER \fB\-\-jobs\fR NOR \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
.br
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Midnight.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to Now.

.LP
WITH \fB\-\-jobs\fR AND WITHOUT \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
.br
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Epoch 0.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to Now.

.LP
WITHOUT \fB\-\-jobs\fR AND WITH \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
.br
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Now.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to \-\-starttime and to Now if \-\-starttime is not specified.

.LP
WITH BOTH \fB\-\-jobs\fR AND \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
.br
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Epoch 0.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to \-\-starttime or to Now if \-\-starttime is not specified.

.PP
\fBNOTE\fR: With \fB\-v/\-\-verbose\fR a message about the actual time
window in use is shown.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsacct\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmdbd\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsacct\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in a
degradation of performance of the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon, possibly resulting in a
denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsacct\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure
calls to \fBslurmdbd\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure
that programs limit calls to \fBsacct\fR to the minimum necessary for the
information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsacct\fR options may
be set via environment variables. These environment variables,
along with their corresponding options, are listed below. (Note:
Command line options will always override these settings.)

.TP 20
\fBSACCT_FEDERATION\fR
Same as \fB\-\-federation\fR
.IP

.TP
\fBSACCT_FORMAT\fR
Allows you to define the columns to display in the output.
Same as \fB\-\-format\fR
.IP

.TP
\fBSACCT_LOCAL\fR
Same as \fB\-\-local\fR
.IP

.TP
\fBSLURM_BITSTR_LEN\fR
Specifies the string length to be used for holding a job array's task ID
expression. The default value is 64 bytes. A value of 0 will print the full
expression with any length required. Larger values may adversely impact the
application performance.
.IP

.TP
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the Slurm configuration file.
.IP

.TP
\fBSLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS\fR
Specify debug flags for sacct to use. See DebugFlags in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment
variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.
.IP

.TP
\fBSLURM_TIME_FORMAT\fR
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of \fIstandard\fR, the
default value, generates output in the form "year\-month\-dateThour:minute:second".
A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

used, the start time of the job will be the specified

By adding the \-T option the job's start and end times are truncated
to reflect only the time requested.  If a job started after the start
time requested or finished before the end time requested those times
are not altered.  The \-T option
is useful when determining exact run times during any given period.

\fBNOTE\fR: If no \fB\-s\fR (\fB\-\-state\fR) option is given sacct will
display eligible jobs during the specified period of time, otherwise it
will return jobs that were in the state requested during that period of
time.

This example demonstrates the differences running sacct with and without
the \fB\-\-state\fR flag for the same time period. Without the
\fB\-\-state\fR option, all eligible jobs in that time period are shown.

With the \fB\-\-state=pending\fR option, only job 2956 will be shown because
it had a dependency on 2955 and was still PENDING from 11:20:00 until it
started at 11:21:13. Note that even though we requested PENDING jobs, the
State shows as COMPLETED because that is the current State of the job.
