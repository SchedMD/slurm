.TH sacct "1" "Slurm Commands" "May 2021" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sacct \- displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the
Slurm job accounting log or Slurm database

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacct\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with Slurm are either logged
in the job accounting log file or saved to the Slurm database, as
configured with the AccountingStorageType parameter.
.PP
The \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting data stored in the job
accounting log file or Slurm database in a variety of forms for your
analysis.  The \f3sacct\fP command displays information on jobs, job
steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output
with the use of the \f3\-\-format=\fP option to specify the fields to
be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting
data for all users, although there are options to filter the output to
report only the jobs from a specified user or group.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the \f3sacct\fP command limits the display of
job accounting data to jobs that were launched with their own user
identifier (UID) by default.  Data for other users can be displayed
with the \f3\-\-allusers\fP, \f3\-\-user\fP, or \f3\-\-uid\fP options.
.PP
Elapsed time fields are presented as
[days-]hours:minutes:seconds[.microseconds]. Only 'CPU' fields will
ever have microseconds.
.PP
The default input file is the file named in the
\f3AccountingStorageLoc\fP parameter in slurm.conf.

\fBNOTE\fR: If designated, the slurmdbd.conf option PrivateData may further
restrict the accounting data visible to users which are not
SlurmUser, root, or a user with AdminLevel=Admin. See the
slurmdbd.conf man page for additional details on restricting
access to accounting data.

\fBNOTE\fR: The contents of Slurm's database are maintained in lower case.
This may result in some \f3sacct\fP output differing from that of other Slurm
commands.

\fBNOTE\fR: Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your systems
\f2getrusage (3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP "10"
\f3\-a\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-allusers\fP
Displays all users' jobs when run by user root or if \fBPrivateData\fP is not
configured to \fBjobs\fP.
Otherwise display the current user's jobs
.IP

.TP
\f3\-A \fP\f2account_list\fP \fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-accounts\fP\f3=\fP\f2account_list\fP
Displays jobs when a comma separated list of accounts are given as the
argument.
.IP

.TP
\f3\-b\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-brief\fP
Displays a brief listing consisting of JobID, State, and ExitCode.
.IP

.TP
\f3\-c\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-completion\fP
Use job completion data instead of job accounting.  The \f3JobCompType\fP
parameter in the slurm.conf file must be defined to a non\-none option.
Does not support federated cluster information (local data only).
.IP

.TP
\f3\-C \fP\f2constraint_list\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-constraints\fP\f3=\fP\f2constraint_list\fP
Comma separated list to filter jobs based on what constraints/features the job
requested.  Multiple options will be treated as 'and' not 'or', so the job would
need all constraints specified to be returned not one or the other.

.TP
\f3\-\-delimiter\f3=\fP\f2characters\fP
ASCII characters used to separate the fields when specifying
the \f3\-p\fP or \f3\-P\fP options. The default delimiter
is a '|'. This option is ignored if \f3\-p\fP or \f3\-P\fP options
are not specified.

.TP
\f3\-D\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-duplicates\fP
If Slurm job ids are reset, some job numbers will probably appear more
than once in the accounting log file but refer to different jobs.
Such jobs can be distinguished by the "submit" time stamp in the data
records.

.IP
When data for specific jobs are requested with the \-\-jobs option,
\f3sacct\fP returns the most recent job with that number. This
behavior can be overridden by specifying \-\-duplicates, in which case
all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.

.IP
NOTE: Revoked federated sibling jobs are hidden unless the \-\-duplicates option
is specified.

.TP
\f3\-e\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-helpformat\fP

.TP
\f3\-s \fP\f2state_list\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-state\fP\f3=\fP\f2state_list\fP
Selects jobs based on their state during the time period given.
Unless otherwise specified, the start and end time will be the
current time when the \f3\-\-state\fP option is specified and
only currently running jobs can be displayed.
A start and/or end time must be specified to view information about
jobs not currently running.
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for a list of state designators.
Multiple state names may be specified using comma separators. Either the short
or long form of the state name may be used (e.g. \f3CA\fP or \f3CANCELLED\fP)
and the name is case insensitive (i.e. \f3ca\fP and \f3CA\fP both work).

NOTE: Note for a job to be selected in the PENDING state it must have
"EligibleTime" in the requested time interval or different from "Unknown". The
"EligibleTime" is displayed by the "scontrol show job" command.  For example
jobs submitted with the "\-\-hold" option will have "EligibleTime=Unknown" as
they are pending indefinitely.

NOTE: When specifying states and no start time is given the default
start time is 'now'.  This is only when \-j is not used.  If \-j is used the
start time will default to 'Epoch'.  In both cases if no end time is given it
will default to 'now'. See the \fBDEFAULT TIME WINDOW\fR for more details.

.TP
\f3\-S\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-starttime\fP
Select jobs in any state after the specified time. Default is 00:00:00
of the
current day, unless the '\-s' or '\-j' options are used. If the '\-s' option is
used, then the default is 'now'. If states are given with the '\-s' option then
only jobs in this state at this time will be returned. If the '\-j' option is
used, then the default time is Unix Epoch 0. See the \fBDEFAULT TIME WINDOW\fR
for more details.

Valid time formats are:
.br
HH:MM[:SS][AM|PM]
.br

.TP
\f3\-T\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-truncate\fP
Truncate time.  So if a job started before \-\-starttime the start time
would be truncated to \-\-starttime.  The same for end time and \-\-endtime.

.TP
\f3\-u \fP\f2uid_list\fP\f3, \-\-uid=\fP\f2uid_list\fP\f3, \-\-user=\fP\f2user_list\fP
Use this comma separated list of uids or user names to select jobs to
display.  By default, the running user's uid is used.

.TP
\f3\-\-use\-local\-uid\fP
When displaying UID, sacct uses the UID stored in Slurm's accounting database
by default. Use this command to make Slurm use a system call to get the UID
from the username. This option may be useful in an environment with multiple
clusters and one database where the UID's aren't the same on all clusters.

.TP
\f3\-\-units=[KMGTP]\fP
Display values in specified unit type. Takes precedence over \-\-noconvert
option.

.TP
\f3\-\-usage\fP
Display a command usage summary.

.TP
\f3\-v\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-verbose\fP
Primarily for debugging purposes, report the state of various
variables during processing.

.TP
\f3\-V\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-version\fP
Print version.

.TP
\f3\-\-whole\-hetjob=[yes|no]\fP
When querying heterogeneous jobs, Slurm by default retrieves the information
about all the components of the job if the het_job_id (leader id) is selected.
If a non\-leader heterogeneous job component id is selected only that component
is retrieved by default. This behavior can be changed by using this option. If
set to 'yes' or no value is set, then information about all the components
will be retrieved no matter which component is selected in the job filter.
Otherwise, if set to 'no' then only the selected heterogeneous job components
will be retrieved, even when selecting the leader.

.TP
\f3\-W \fP\f2wckey_list\fP\f3, \-\-wckeys=\fP\f2wckey_list\fP
Displays the statistics only for the jobs started on the wckeys
specified by the \f2wckey_list\fP operand, which is a comma\-separated
list of wckey names.  Space characters are not allowed in the
\f2wckey_list\fP. Default is all wckeys\&.

.TP
\f3\-x \fP\f2associd_list\fP\f3, -\-associations=\fP\f2assoc_list\fP
Displays the statistics only for the jobs running under the
association ids specified by the \f2assoc_list\fP operand, which is a
comma\-separated list of association ids.  Space characters are not
allowed in the \f2assoc_list\fP. Default is all associations\&.

.TP
\f3\-X\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-allocations\fP
Only show statistics relevant to the job allocation itself, not taking steps
into consideration.

\fBNOTE\fR: Without including steps, utilization statistics for job
allocation(s) will be reported as zero.

.SH "DEFAULT TIME WINDOW"
.PP
The options \-\-starttime and \-\-endtime define the time window between
which \fBsacct\fR is going to search. For historical and practical
reasons their default values (i.e. the default time window)
depends on other options: \-\-jobs and \-\-state.

Depending on if \-\-jobs and/or \-\-state are specified, the default
values of \fB\-\-starttime\fR  and \fB\-\-endtime\fR options are:

.TP
\f3WITHOUT EITHER \fB\-\-jobs\fR NOR \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Midnight.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to Now.
.br
.br

.TP
\f3WITH \fB\-\-jobs\fR AND WITHOUT \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Epoch 0.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to Now.
.br
.br

.TP
\f3WITHOUT \fB\-\-jobs\fR AND WITH \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Now.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to \-\-starttime and to Now if \-\-starttime is not specified.
.br
.br

.TP
\f3WITH BOTH \fB\-\-jobs\fR AND \fB\-\-state\fR\fP specified:
\fB\-\-starttime\fR defaults to Epoch 0.
.br
\fB\-\-endtime\fR defaults to \-\-starttime or to Now if \-\-starttime is not specified.

.PP
\fBNOTE\fR: With \fB\-v/\-\-verbose\fR a message about the actual time
window in use is shown.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsacct\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmdbd\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsacct\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in a
degradation of performance of the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon, possibly resulting in a
denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsacct\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure
calls to \fBslurmdbd\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure
that programs limit calls to \fBsacct\fR to the minimum necessary for the
information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsacct\fR options may
be set via environment variables. These environment variables,
along with their corresponding options, are listed below. (Note:
Command line options will always override these settings.)
.TP 20
\fBSACCT_FEDERATION\fR
Same as \fB\-\-federation\fR
.TP
\fBSACCT_LOCAL\fR
Same as \fB\-\-local\fR
.TP
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the Slurm configuration file.
.TP
\fBSLURM_TIME_FORMAT\fR
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of \fIstandard\fR, the
default value, generates output in the form "year\-month\-dateThour:minute:second".
A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

By adding the \-T option the job's start and end times are truncated
to reflect only the time requested.  If a job started after the start
time requested or finished before the end time requested those times
are not altered.  The \-T option
is useful when determining exact run times during any given period.
