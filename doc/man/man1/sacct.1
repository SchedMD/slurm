.TH sacct "1" "Slurm Commands" "April 2015" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sacct \- displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the
SLURM job accounting log or SLURM database

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacct\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with SLURM are either logged
in the job accounting log file or saved to the SLURM database.
.PP
The \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting data stored in the job
accounting log file or SLURM database in a variety of forms for your
analysis.  The \f3sacct\fP command displays information on jobs, job
steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output
with the use of the \f3\-\-format=\fP option to specify the fields to
be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting
data for all users, although there are options to filter the output to
report only the jobs from a specified user or group.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the \f3sacct\fP command limits the display of
job accounting data to jobs that were launched with their own user
identifier (UID) by default.  Data for other users can be displayed
with the \f3\-\-allusers\fP, \f3\-\-user\fP, or \f3\-\-uid\fP options.
.TP "7"
\f3Note: \fP\c
If designated, the slurmdbd.conf option PrivateData may further
restrict the accounting data visible to users which are not
SlurmUser, root, or a user with AdminLevel=Admin. See the
slurmdbd.conf man page for additional details on restricting
access to accounting data.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
If the AccountingStorageType is set to "accounting_storage/filetxt",
space characters embedded within account names, job names, and step names
will be replaced by underscores. If account names with embedded spaces are
needed, it is recommended that a database type of accounting storage be
configured.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
The content's of SLURM's database are maintained in lower case. This may
result in some \f3sacct\fP output differing from that of other SLURM commands.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your systems
\f2getrusage (3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.
.IP
Elapsed time fields are presented as
[days-]hours:minutes:seconds[.microseconds].  Only 'CPU' fields will
ever have microseconds.
.IP
The default input file is the file named in the
\f3AccountingStorageLoc\fP parameter in slurm.conf.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP "10"
\f3\-a\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-allusers\fP
Displays all users jobs when run by user root or if \fBPrivateData\fP is not
configured to \fBjobs\fP.
Otherwise display the current user's jobs
.IP

.TP
\f3\-A \fP\f2account_list\fP \fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-accounts\fP\f3=\fP\f2account_list\fP

\f3\-c\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-completion\fP
Use job completion instead of job accounting.  The \f3JobCompType\fP
parameter in the slurm.conf file must be defined to a non-none option.
.IP

.TP
\f3\-D\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-duplicates\fP
If SLURM job ids are reset, some job numbers will probably appear more
than once in the accounting log file but refer to different jobs.
Such jobs can be distinguished by the "submit" time stamp in the data
records.

.IP
When data for specific jobs are requested with the \-\-jobs option,
\f3sacct\fP returns the most recent job with that number. This
behavior can be overridden by specifying \-\-duplicates, in which case
all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.

Note: Only in case of exclusive job allocation this value
reflects the jobs' real energy consumption.

to display all duplicate entries for a job.

.TP
\f3SystemCPU\fP
The amount of system CPU time used by the job or job step.  The format

A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

This example demonstrates the use of the \-T (\-\-truncate) option when
used with \-S (\-\-starttime) and \-E (\-\-endtime). When the \-T option is
used, the start time of the job will be the specified
\-S value if the job was started before the specified time, otherwise
the time will be the job's start time. The end time will be the specified \-E
option if the job ends after the specified time, otherwise it will be
the jobs end time.

NOTE: If no \-s (\-\-state) option is given sacct will
display jobs that ran durning the specified time, otherwise it returns
jobs that were in the state requested durning that period of time.

Without \-T (normal operation) sacct output would be like this.

By adding the \-T option the job's start and end times are truncated
to reflect only the time requested.  If a job started after the start
time requested or finished before the end time requested those times
are not altered.  The \-T option
is useful when determining exact run times durning any given period.
