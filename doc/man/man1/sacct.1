.TH sacct "1" "Slurm Commands" "June 2018" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sacct \- displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the
Slurm job accounting log or Slurm database

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacct\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with Slurm are either logged
in the job accounting log file or saved to the Slurm database.
.PP
The \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting data stored in the job
accounting log file or Slurm database in a variety of forms for your
analysis.  The \f3sacct\fP command displays information on jobs, job
steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output
with the use of the \f3\-\-format=\fP option to specify the fields to
be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting
data for all users, although there are options to filter the output to
report only the jobs from a specified user or group.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the \f3sacct\fP command limits the display of
job accounting data to jobs that were launched with their own user
identifier (UID) by default.  Data for other users can be displayed
with the \f3\-\-allusers\fP, \f3\-\-user\fP, or \f3\-\-uid\fP options.
.TP "7"
\f3Note: \fP\c
If designated, the slurmdbd.conf option PrivateData may further
restrict the accounting data visible to users which are not
SlurmUser, root, or a user with AdminLevel=Admin. See the
slurmdbd.conf man page for additional details on restricting
access to accounting data.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
If the AccountingStorageType is set to "accounting_storage/filetxt",
space characters embedded within account names, job names, and step names
will be replaced by underscores. If account names with embedded spaces are
needed, it is recommended that a database type of accounting storage be
configured.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
The content's of Slurm's database are maintained in lower case. This may
result in some \f3sacct\fP output differing from that of other Slurm commands.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your systems
\f2getrusage (3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.
.IP
Elapsed time fields are presented as
[days-]hours:minutes:seconds[.microseconds].  Only 'CPU' fields will
ever have microseconds.
.IP
The default input file is the file named in the
\f3AccountingStorageLoc\fP parameter in slurm.conf.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP "10"
\f3\-a\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-allusers\fP

\f3\-c\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-completion\fP
Use job completion data instead of job accounting.  The \f3JobCompType\fP
parameter in the slurm.conf file must be defined to a non\-none option.
Does not support federated cluster information (local data only).
.IP

.TP
\f3\-\-delimiter\f3=\fP\f2characters\fP
ASCII characters used to separate the fields when specifying
the \f3\-p\fP or \f3\-P\fP options. The default delimiter
is a '|'. This options is ignored if \f3\-p\fP or \f3\-P\fP options
are not specified.

.TP
\f3\-D\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-duplicates\fP
If Slurm job ids are reset, some job numbers will probably appear more
than once in the accounting log file but refer to different jobs.
Such jobs can be distinguished by the "submit" time stamp in the data
records.

.IP
When data for specific jobs are requested with the \-\-jobs option,
\f3sacct\fP returns the most recent job with that number. This
behavior can be overridden by specifying \-\-duplicates, in which case
all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.

.IP
NOTE: Revoked federated sibling jobs are hidden unless the \-\-duplicates option
is specified.

Selects jobs based on their state during the time period given.
Unless otherwise specified, the start and end time will be the
current time when the \f3\-\-state\fP option is specified and
only currently running jobs can be displayed.
A start and/or end time must be specified to view information about
jobs not currently running.
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for a list of state designators.
Multiple state names may be specified using comma separators. Either the short

and the name is case insensitive (e.g. \f3ca\fP and \f3CA\fP both work).

NOTE: Note for a job to be selected in the PENDING state it must have
"EligibleTime" in the requested time interval or different from "Unknown". The
"EligibleTime" is displayed by the "scontrol show job" command.  For example
jobs submitted with the "\-\-hold" option will have "EligibleTime=Unknown" as
they are pending indefinitely.

NOTE: When specifying states and no start time is given the default
starttime is 'now'.

.TP
\f3\-S\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-starttime\fP
Select eligible jobs in any state after the specified time. Default is 00:00:00
of the

\f3\-\-whole\-hetjob=[yes|no]\fP
When querying heterogeneous jobs, Slurm by default retrieves the information
about all the components of the job if the pack_job_id (leader) is selected. If
a non-leader hetjob component is selected only that component is retrieved by
default. This behavior can be changed by using this option. If set to 'yes' or
no value is set, then information about all the components will be retrieved no
matter which component is selected in the job filter. Otherwise, if set to 'no'
then only the selected hetjob components will be retrieved, even when selecting
the leader.

.TP
\f3\-W \fP\f2wckey_list\fP\f3, \-\-wckeys=\fP\f2wckey_list\fP
Displays the statistics only for the jobs started on the wckeys

\f3ReservationId\fP
Reservation Id.

.TP
\f3Reserved\fP
How much wall clock time was used as reserved time for this job.  This is
derived from how long a job was waiting from eligible time to when it
actually started.

.TP
\f3ResvCPU\fP
Formatted time for how long (cpu secs) a job was reserved for.

.TP
\f3ResvCPURAW\fP
Reserved CPUs in second format, not formatted.

.TP
\f3Start\fP
Initiation time of the job in the same format as \f3End\fP.

.TP
\f3State\fP
Displays the job status, or state.
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for a list of possible states.

If more information is available on the job state
than will fit into the current field width (for example, the uid that CANCELLED
a job) the state will be followed by a "+".  You can increase the size of
the displayed state using the "%NUMBER" format modifier described earlier.

NOTE: The RUNNING state will return suspended jobs as well.  In order
to print suspended jobs you must request SUSPENDED at a different call
from RUNNING.

NOTE: The RUNNING state will return any jobs completed (cancelled or otherwise)
in the time period requested as the job was also RUNNING durning that time.  If
you are only looking for job that finished please choose the appropriate
state(s) without the RUNNING state.

.TP
\f3Submit\fP
The  time and date stamp (in localtime) the job was submitted.
The format of the output is identical to that of the \f3End\fP
field.

NOTE: If a job is requeued, the submit time is reset.  To obtain the
original submit time it is necessary to use the \-D or \-\-duplicate option
to display all duplicate entries for a job.

.TP
\f3Suspended\fP
How long the job was suspended for.

.TP
\f3SystemCPU\fP
The amount of system CPU time used by the job or job step.  The format
of the output is identical to that of the \f3Elapsed\fP field.

NOTE: SystemCPU provides a measure of the task's parent process and
does not include CPU time of child processes.

.TP
\f3Timelimit\fP
What the timelimit was/is for the job.

.TP
\f3TimelimitRaw\fP
What the timelimit was/is for the job, not formatted.

.TP
\f3TotalCPU\fP
The sum of the SystemCPU and UserCPU time used by the job or job step.
The total CPU time of the job may exceed the job's elapsed time for
jobs that include multiple job steps.  The format of the output is
identical to that of the \f3Elapsed\fP field.

NOTE: TotalCPU provides a measure of the task's parent process and
does not include CPU time of child processes.

.TP
\f3TresUsageInAve\fP
Tres average usage in by all tasks in job.
NOTE: If corresponding TresUsageInMaxTask is -1 the metric is node centric
instead of task.

.TP
\f3TresUsageInMax\fP
Tres maximum usage in by all tasks in job.
NOTE: If corresponding TresUsageInMaxTask is -1 the metric is node centric
instead of task.

.TP
\f3TresUsageInMaxNode\fP
Node for which each maximum TRES usage out occurred.

.TP
\f3TresUsageInMaxTask\fP
Task for which each maximum TRES usage out occurred.

.TP
\f3TresUsageOutAve\fP
Tres average usage out by all tasks in job.
NOTE: If corresponding TresUsageOutMaxTask is -1 the metric is node centric
instead of task.

.TP
\f3TresUsageOutMax\fP
Tres maximum usage out by all tasks in job.
NOTE: If corresponding TresUsageOutMaxTask is -1 the metric is node centric

.TP
\f3User\fP
The user name of the user who ran the job.

.TP
\f3UserCPU\fP
The amount of user CPU time used by the job or job step.  The format
of the output is identical to that of the \f3Elapsed\fP field.

NOTE: UserCPU provides a measure of the task's parent process and does
not include CPU time of child processes.

.TP
\f3WCKey\fP
Workload  Characterization  Key.   Arbitrary  string for grouping orthogonal accounts together.

.TP
\f3WCKeyID\fP
Reference to the wckey.


.SH "JOB STATE CODES"

.TP 20
\f3BF  BOOT_FAIL\fR
Job terminated due to launch failure, typically due to a hardware failure
(e.g. unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).
.TP
\f3CA  CANCELLED\fP

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsacct\fR options may
be set via environment variables. These environment variables,
along with their corresponding options, are listed below. (Note:
Commandline options will always override these settings.)
.TP 20
\fBSACCT_FEDERATION\fR
Same as \fB\-\-federation\fR
.TP
\fBSACCT_LOCAL\fR
Same as \fB\-\-local\fR
.TP
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the Slurm configuration file.
.TP
\fBSLURM_TIME_FORMAT\fR
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of \fIstandard\fR, the
default value, generates output in the form "year\-month\-dateThour:minute:second".
A value of \fIrelative\fR returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.
For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by
"Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming
week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").
For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.
"6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of
"%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

This example demonstrates the use of the \-T (\-\-truncate) option when
used with \-S (\-\-starttime) and \-E (\-\-endtime). When the \-T option is
used, the start time of the job will be the specified
\-S value if the job was started before the specified time, otherwise
the time will be the job's start time. The end time will be the specified \-E
option if the job ends after the specified time, otherwise it will be
the jobs end time.

NOTE: If no \-s (\-\-state) option is given sacct will
display jobs that ran during the specified time, otherwise it returns
jobs that were in the state requested during that period of time.

Without \-T (normal operation) sacct output would be like this.

By adding the \-T option the job's start and end times are truncated
to reflect only the time requested.  If a job started after the start
time requested or finished before the end time requested those times
are not altered.  The \-T option
is useful when determining exact run times during any given period.
