.SH "NAME"
sacct \- displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the
SLURM job accounting log or SLURM database

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacct\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with SLURM are either logged
in the job accounting log file or saved to the SLURM database.
.PP
The \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting data stored in the job
accounting log file or SLURM database in a variety of forms for your
analysis.  The \f3sacct\fP command displays information on jobs, job
steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output
with the use of the \f3\-\-format=\fP option to specify the fields to
be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the \f3sacct\fP command displays job accounting
data for all users, although there are options to filter the output to
report only the jobs from a specified user or group.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the \f3sacct\fP command limits the display of
job accounting data to jobs that were launched with their own user
identifier (UID) by default.  Data for other users can be displayed
with the \f3\-\-allusers\fP, \f3\-\-user\fP, or \f3\-\-uid\fP options.
.TP "7"
\f3Note: \fP\c
If designated, the slurmdbd.conf option PrivateData may further
restrict the accounting data visible to users which are not
SlurmUser, root, or a user with AdminLevel=Admin. See the 
slurmdbd.conf man page for additional details on restricting
access to accounting data.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
If the AccountingStorageType is set to "accounting_storage/filetxt",
space characters embedded within account names, job names, and step names
will be replaced by underscores. If account names with embedded spaces are
needed, it is recommended that a database type of accounting storage be
configured.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
The content's of SLURM's database are maintained in lower case. This may
result in some \f3sacct\fP output differing from that of other SLURM commands.
.TP
\f3Note: \fP\c
Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your systems
\f2getrusage (3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.
.IP
Elapsed time fields are presented as 2 fields, integral seconds and integral microseconds
.IP
Elapsed time fields are presented as
[[days-]hours:]minutes:seconds.hundredths.
.IP
The default input file is the file named in the
\f3AccountingStorageLoc\fP parameter in slurm.conf.

\f3\-c\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-completion\fP
Use job completion instead of job accounting.  The \f3JobCompType\fP
parameter in the slurm.conf file must be defined to a non-none option.
.IP

.TP
\f3\-D\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-duplicates\fP
If SLURM job ids are reset, some job numbers will probably appear more
than once in the accounting log file but refer to different jobs.
Such jobs can be distinguished by the "submit" time stamp in the data
records.

.IP
When data for specific jobs are requested with the \-\-jobs option,
\f3sacct\fP returns the most recent job with that number. This
behavior can be overridden by specifying \-\-duplicates, in which case
all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.

a job) the state will be followed by a "+".  You can increase the size of
the displayed state using the "%NUMBER" format modifier described earlier.

.TP
\f3submit\fP
The  time and date stamp (in Universal Time Coordinated, UTC) the job
was submitted.  The format of the output is identical to that of the end field.
