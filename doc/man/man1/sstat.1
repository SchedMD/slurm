.TH sstat "1" "Slurm Commands" "Slurm 26.05" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sstat \- Display the status information of a running job/step.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsstat\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Status information for running jobs invoked with Slurm.
.PP
The \fBsstat\fR command displays job status information for your analysis.
The \fBsstat\fR command displays information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node,
Resident Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory (VM).
You can tailor the output with the use of the \fB\-\-fields=\fR
option to specify the fields to be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the \fBsstat\fR command displays job status data for any
job running on the system.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the \fBsstat\fR output is limited to the user's jobs.

.PP
\fBNOTE\fR: The \fBsstat\fR command requires that the \fBjobacct_gather\fP
plugin be installed and operational.

\fBNOTE\fR: Availability of metrics rely on the \fBjobacct_gather\fP plugin
used. For example the jobacct_gather/cgroup in combination with cgroup/v2 does
not provide Virtual Memory metrics due to limitations in the kernel cgroups
interfaces and will show a 0 for the related fields.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-allsteps\fR
Print all steps for the given job(s) when no step is specified.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR, \fB\-\-fields\fR
Comma separated list of fields.
(use '\-\-helpformat' for a list of available fields).

\fBNOTE\fR: When using the format option for listing various fields you can put
a %NUMBER afterwards to specify how many characters should be printed.

i.e. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right
justified. A \-30 will print 30 characters left justified.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Displays a general help message.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-helpformat\fR
Print a list of fields that can be specified with the '\-\-format' option.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR
Format is <job(.step)>. Stat this job step or comma\-separated list of
job steps. This option is required. The step portion will default to
the lowest numbered (not batch, extern, etc) step running if not specified,
unless the \-\-allsteps flag is set where not specifying a step will result in
all running steps to be displayed.
\fBNOTE\fR: A step id of 'batch' will display the information about the batch
step.
\fBNOTE\fR: A step id of 'extern' will display the information about the
extern step. This step is only available when using PrologFlags=contain

.SS "Job Status Fields"
Descriptions of each field option can be found below.
Note that the Ave*, Max* and Min* accounting fields look at the values for
all the tasks of each step in a job and return the average, maximum or minimum
values of the task for that job step. For example, for MaxRSS, the returned
value is the maximum memory consumption seen by one of the tasks of the step,
and MaxRSSTask shows which task it is.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsstat\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmctld\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsstat\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsstat\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure
calls to \fBslurmctld\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure
that programs limit calls to \fBsstat\fR to the minimum necessary for the
information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsstat\fR options may be set via environment variables. These
environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.
(Note: Command line options will always override these settings.)

.TP 20
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the Slurm configuration file.
.IP

.TP
\fBSLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS\fR
Specify debug flags for sstat to use. See DebugFlags in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment
variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.
