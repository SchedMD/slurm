.TH SSTAT "1" "August 2011" "sstat 2.3" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
sstat \- Display various status information
of a running job/step.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BR "sstat "
[\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Status information for running jobs invoked with SLURM.
.PP
The
.BR "sstat "
command displays job status information for your analysis.
The
.BR "sstat "
command displays information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node, Resident
Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory (VM).
You can tailor the output with the use of the
\f3\-\-fields=\fP
option to specify the fields to be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the
.BR "sstat "
command displays job status data for any job running on the system.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the
.BR "sstat "
output is limited to the user's jobs.

.PP
NOTE:  The
.BR "sstat "
command requires that the \f3jobacct_gather\fP plugin be installed and
operational.
.PP
NOTE:  The
.BR "sstat "
command is not supported on Cray or IBM BlueGene systems. 

.TP
\f3\-a\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-allsteps\fP
Print all steps for the given job(s) when no step is specified.

.TP
\f3\-e\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-helpformat\fP
Print a list of fields that can be specified with the '\-\-format' option.

.TP
\f3\-h\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-help\fP
Displays a general help message.

.TP
\f3\-i\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-pidformat\fP
Predefined format to list the pids running for each job step.
(JobId,Nodes,Pids)

.TP
\f3\-j\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-jobs\fP
Format is <job(.step)>. Stat this job step or comma-separated list of
job steps. This option is required.  The step portion will default to
lowest step running if not specified, unless the \-\-allsteps flag is
set where not specifying a step will result in all running steps to be
displayed.
NOTE: A step id of 'batch' will display the information about the batch step.

.TP
\f3\-n\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-noheader\fP
No heading will be added to the output. The default action is to
display a header.

.TP
\f3\-o\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-format\fP,\fP \f3\-\-fields\fP
Comma separated list of fields.
(use '\-\-helpformat' for a list of available fields).

NOTE: When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a
%NUMBER afterwards to specify how many characters should be printed.

i.e. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right
justified.  A \-30 will print 30 characters left justified.

.TP
\f3\-p\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-parsable\fP
output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end

.TP
\f3\-P\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-parsable2\fP
output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end

.TP
\f3\-\-usage\fP
Display a command usage summary.

.TP
\f3\-v\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-verbose\fP
Primarily for debugging purposes, report the state of various
variables during processing.

.TP
\f3\-V\fP\f3,\fP \f3\-\-version\fP
Print version.
