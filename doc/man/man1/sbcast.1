.TH SBCAST "1" "April 2006" "sbcast 2.0" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
sbcast \- transmit a file to the nodes allocated to a SLURM job.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsbcast\fR [\-CfpstvV] SOURCE DEST

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsbcast\fR is used to transmit a file to all nodes allocated
to the currently active SLURM job.
This command should only be executed from within a SLURM batch
job or within the shell spawned after a SLURM job's resource
allocation.
\fBSOURCE\fR is the name of a file on the current node.
\fBDEST\fR should be the fully qualified pathname for the
file copy to be created on each node.
\fBDEST\fR should be on a file system local to that node.
Note that parallel file systems \fImay\fR provide better performance
than \fBsbcast\fR can provide, although performance will vary
by file size, degree of parallelism, and network type.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-compress\fR
Compress the file being transmitted.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
If the destination file already exists, replace it.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR \fInumber\fR, \fB\-\-fanout\fR=\fInumber\fR
Specify the fanout of messages used for file transfer.
Maximum value is currently eight.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preserve\fR
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original file.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIsize\fR, \fB\-\-size\fR=\fIsize\fR
Specify the block size used for file broadcast.
The size can have a suffix of \fIk\fR or \fIm\fR for kilobytes
or megabytes respectively (defaults to bytes).
This size subject to rounding and range limits to maintain
good performance. This value may need to be set on systems
with very limited memory.
.TP
\fB\-t\fB \fIseconds\fR, fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fIseconds\fR
Specify the message timeout in seconds.
The default value is \fIMessageTimeout\fR as reported by
"scontrol show config".
Setting a higher value may be necessitated by relatively slow
I/O performance on the compute node disks.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Provide detailed event logging through program execution.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsbcast\fR options may be set via environment variables.
These environment variables, along with their corresponding options,
are listed below. (Note: Command line options will always override
these settings.)
.TP 20
\fBSBCAST_COMPRESS\fR
\fB\-C, \-\-compress\fR
.TP
\fBSBCAST_FANOUT\fR
\fB\-F\fB \fInumber\fR, fB\-\-fanout\fR=\fInumber\fR
.TP
\fBSBCAST_FORCE\fR
\fB\-f, \-\-force\fR
.TP
\fBSBCAST_PRESERVE\fR
\fB\-p, \-\-preserve\fR
.TP
\fBSBCAST_SIZE\fR
\fB\-s\fR \fIsize\fR, \fB\-\-size\fR=\fIsize\fR
.TP
\fBSBCAST_TIMEOUT\fR
\fB\-t\fB \fIseconds\fR, fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fIseconds\fR

.SH "AUTHORIZATION"

When using the SLURM db, users who have AdminLevel's defined (Operator
or Admin) and users who are account coordinators are given the
authority to invoke sbcast on other user's jobs.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

Using a batch script, transmit local file \fBmy.prog\fR to
\fB/tmp/my.proc\fR on the local nodes and then execute it.

.nf
> cat my.job
#!/bin/bash
sbcast my.prog /tmp/my.prog
srun /tmp/my.prog

> sbatch \-\-nodes=8 my.job
srun: jobid 12345 submitted
.fi
