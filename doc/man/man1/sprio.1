.SH "NAME"
sprio \- view the factors that comprise a job's scheduling priority

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsprio\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsprio\fR is used to view the components of a job's scheduling
priority when the multi-factor priority plugin is installed.
\fBsprio\fR is a read-only utility that extracts information from the
multi-factor priority plugin.  By default, \fBsprio\fR returns
information for all pending jobs.  Options exist to display specific
jobs by job ID and user name.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all options \fBsprio\fR.

.TP
\fB\-j <job_id_list>\fR, \fB\-\-jobs=<job_id_list>\fR
Requests a comma separated list of job ids to display.  Defaults to
all jobs. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing
the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value
and not include a space between them. For example "\-j1008,1009" and
not "\-j 1008,1009".

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Report more of the available information for the selected jobs.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-norm\fR
Display the normalized priority factors for the selected jobs.

.TP
\fB\-o <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<output_format>\fR
Specify the information to be displayed, its size and position (right
or left justified).  The default formats when all factors have been
assigned non-zero weights are

.RS
.TP 15
\fIdefault\fR
"%.15i %.10Y %.10A %.10F %.10J %.10P %.10Q %20T"
.TP
\fI\-l, \-\-long\fR
"%.15i %.8u %.10Y %.10A %.10F %.10J %.10P %.10Q %.6N %20T"
.RE

.IP
The format of each field is "%[.][size]type".
.RS
.TP 8
\fIsize\fR
is the minimum field size.
If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be used.
.TP
\fI .\fR
indicates the output should be left justified.
By default, output is right justified.
.RE

.IP
Valid \fItype\fR specifications include:

.RE

.TP
\fB\-u <user_list>\fR, \fB\-\-user=<user_list>\fR
Request jobs from a comma separated list of users.  The list can
consist of user names or user id numbers.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief help message listing the \fBsprio\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report details of sprios actions.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.TP
\fB\-w\fR , \fB\-\-weights\fR Display the configured weights for each
factor.  This is for information purposes only.  Actual job data is
suppressed.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
If no corresponding commandline option is specified, \fBsprio\fR will use the value of
the following environment variables.
.TP 20
\fBSLURM_CLUSTERS\fR
Same as \fB\-\-clusters\fR
.TP
