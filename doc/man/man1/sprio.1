.SH "NAME"
sprio \- view the factors that comprise a job's scheduling priority

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsprio\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsprio\fR is used to view the components of a job's scheduling
priority when the multi-factor priority plugin is installed.
\fBsprio\fR is a read-only utility that extracts information from the
multi-factor priority plugin.  By default, \fBsprio\fR returns
information for all pending jobs.  Options exist to display specific
jobs by job ID and user name.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Show jobs in federation if a member of one.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all options \fBsprio\fR.

.TP
\fB\-j <job_id_list>\fR, \fB\-\-jobs=<job_id_list>\fR
Requests a comma separated list of job ids to display.  Defaults to
all jobs. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing
the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value
and not include a space between them. For example "\-j1008,1009" and
not "\-j 1008,1009".

.TP
\fB\-\-local\fR
Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation
(if any). Overrides \-\-federation.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Report more of the available information for the selected jobs.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.
This option implicitly sets the \fB\-\-local\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-norm\fR
Display the normalized priority factors for the selected jobs.

.TP
\fB\-o <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<output_format>\fR
Specify the information to be displayed, its size and position (right
or left justified).  The default formats when all factors have been
assigned non-zero weights are

.RS
.TP 15
\fIdefault\fR
"%.15i %9r %.10Y %.10S %.10A %.10B %.10F %.10J %.10P %.10Q %20T"
.TP
\fI\-l, \-\-long\fR
"%.15i %9r %.8u %.10Y %.10S %.10A %.10B %.10F %.10J %.10P %.10Q %.11N %.20T";
.RE

.IP
The format of each field is "%[.][size]type".
.RS
.TP 8
\fIsize\fR
is the minimum field size.
If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be used.
.TP
\fI .\fR
indicates the output should be left justified.
By default, output is right justified.
.RE

.RE

.TP
\fB-S <sort_list>\fR, \fB--sort=<sort_list>\fR
Specification of the order in which jobs should be reported. This uses the same
field specification as <output_format>. Multiple sorts may be performed by
listing multiple sort fields separated by commas. The field specifications may
be preceded by "+" or "\-" for ascending (default) or descending respectively.
For example, a <sort_list> of "u,r,\-y" will sort the job priority reports by
username, partition name, and descending job priority, in that order. The
default <sort_list> is "i" (ascending job id).

.TP
\fB\-p <partition_list>\fR, \fB\-\-partition=<partition_list>\fR
Requests a comma separated list of partitions to display.  Defaults to
all partitions.

.TP
\fB\-\-sibling\fR
Show all sibling jobs on a federated cluster. Without this option in a
federated cluster, each job in each partition will have its priority and its
components reported for only one cluster. Each sibling job on the various
clusters in the federation may have different priority, which will not be
reported without using this option. Implicitly adds "%c" (cluster name) to the
output format.

.TP
\fB\-u <user_list>\fR, \fB\-\-user=<user_list>\fR
Request jobs from a comma separated list of users.  The list can
consist of user names or user id numbers.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief help message listing the \fBsprio\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report details of sprios actions.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.TP
\fB\-w\fR , \fB\-\-weights\fR
Display the configured weights for each factor.  This is for information
purposes only.  Actual job data is suppressed.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsprio\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmctld\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsprio\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in
a degradation of performance of the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsprio\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure
calls to \fBslurmctld\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure
that programs limit calls to \fBsprio\fR to the minimum necessary for the
information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
If no corresponding command line option is specified, \fBsprio\fR will use the
value of the following environment variables.
.TP 20
\fBSLURM_CLUSTERS\fR
Same as \fB\-\-clusters\fR

.TP
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the Slurm configuration file.
