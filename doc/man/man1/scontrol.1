.TH scontrol "1" "Slurm Commands" "November 2016" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
scontrol \- Used view and modify Slurm configuration and state.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBscontrol\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBscontrol\fR is used to view or modify Slurm configuration including: job,
job step, node, partition, reservation, and overall system configuration. Most
of the commands can only be executed by user root or an Administrator. If an
attempt to view or modify configuration information is made by an unauthorized
user, an error message will be printed and the requested action will not occur.
If no command is entered on the execute line, \fBscontrol\fR will operate in an
interactive mode and prompt for input. It will continue prompting for input and
executing commands until explicitly terminated. If a command is entered on the
execute line, \fBscontrol\fR will execute that command and terminate. All
commands and options are case\-insensitive, although node names, partition
names, and reservation names are case\-sensitive (node names "LX" and "lx" are
distinct). All commands and options can be abbreviated to the extent that the
specification is unique. A modified Slurm configuration can be written to
a file using the \fIscontrol write config\fR command. The resulting file
will be named using the convention "slurm.conf.<datetime>" and located in the
same directory as the original "slurm.conf" file. The directory containing
the original slurm.conf must be writable for this to occur.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
When the \fIshow\fR command is used, then display all partitions, their jobs
and jobs steps. This causes information to be displayed about partitions
that are configured as hidden and partitions that are unavailable to user's
group.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-details\fR
Causes the \fIshow\fR command to provide additional details where available.
Repeating the option more than once (e.g., "\-dd") will cause the \fIshow job\fR
command to also list the batch script, if the job was a batch job.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing the usage of scontrol.
.TP
\fB\-\-hide\fR
Do not display information about hidden partitions, their jobs and job steps.
By default, neither partitions that are configured as hidden nor those partitions
unavailable to user's group will be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-clusters\fR=<\fIstring\fR>
The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.
Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-oneliner\fR
Print information one line per record.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-uid\fR=<\fIuid\fR>
Attempt to update a job as user <uid> instead of the invoking user id.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print detailed event logging. Multiple \fB\-v\fR's will further increase
the verbosity of logging. By default only errors will be displayed.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.
.TP
\fBCOMMANDS\fR

.TP
\fBabort\fP
Instruct the Slurm controller to terminate immediately and generate a core file.
See "man slurmctld" for information about where the core file will be
written.

.TP
\fBcheckpoint\fP \fICKPT_OP\fP \fIID\fP
Perform a checkpoint activity on the job step(s) with the specified identification.
\fIID\fP can be used to identify a specific job (e.g. "<job_id>",
which applies to all of its existing steps)
or a specific job step (e.g. "<job_id>.<step_id>").
Acceptable values for \fICKPT_OP\fP include:
.RS
.TP 12
\fIable\fP
Test if presently not disabled, report start time if checkpoint in progress
.TP
\fIcreate\fP
Create a checkpoint and continue the job or job step
.TP
\fIdisable\fP
Disable future checkpoints
.TP
\fIenable\fP
Enable future checkpoints
.TP
\fIerror\fP
Report the result for the last checkpoint request, error code and message
.TP
\fIrestart\fP
Restart execution of the previously checkpointed job or job step
.TP
\fIrequeue\fP
Create a checkpoint and requeue the batch job, combines vacate
and restart operations
.TP
\fIvacate\fP
Create a checkpoint and terminate the job or job step
.RE
Acceptable values for \fICKPT_OP\fP include:
.RS
.TP 20
\fIMaxWait=<seconds>\fP
Maximum time for checkpoint to be written.
Default value is 10 seconds.
Valid with \fIcreate\fP and \fIvacate\fP options only.
.TP
\fIImageDir=<directory_name>\fP
Location of checkpoint file.
Valid with \fIcreate\fP, \fIvacate\fP and \fIrestart\fP options only.
This value takes precedent over any \-\-checkpoint\-dir value specified
at job submission time.
.TP
\fIStickToNodes\fP
If set, resume job on the same nodes are previously used.
Valid with the \fIrestart\fP option only.
.RE

.TP
\fBcluster\fR \fICLUSTER_NAME\fP
The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.

.TP
\fBcreate\fP \fISPECIFICATION\fP
Create a new partition or reservation.  See the full list of parameters
below.  Include the tag "res" to create a reservation without specifying
a reservation name.

.TP
\fBcompleting\fP
Display all jobs in a COMPLETING state along with associated nodes in either a
COMPLETING or DOWN state.

.TP
\fBdelete\fP \fISPECIFICATION\fP
Delete the entry with the specified \fISPECIFICATION\fP.
The two \fISPECIFICATION\fP choices are \fIPartitionName=<name>\fP and
\fIReservation=<name>\fP.  On Dynamically laid out Bluegene systems
\fIBlockName=<name>\fP also works. Reservations and partitions should have
no associated jobs at the time of their deletion (modify the job's first).
If the specified partition is in use, the request is denied.

.TP
\fBerrnumstr\fP \fIERRNO\fP
Given a Slurm error number, return a descriptive string.

.TP
\fBhelp\fP
Display a description of scontrol options and commands.

.TP
\fBhold\fP \fIjob_list\fP
Prevent a pending job from being started (sets it's priority to 0).
Use the \fIrelease\fP command to permit the job to be scheduled.
The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs OR
"jobname=" with the job's name, which will attempt to hold all jobs having
that name.
Note that when a job is held by a system administrator using the \fBhold\fP
command, only a system administrator may release the job for execution (also
see the \fBuhold\fP command). When the job is held by its owner, it may also
be released by the job's owner.
Additionally, attempting to hold a running job will have not suspend or cancel
it. But, it will set the job priority to 0 and update the job reason field,
which would hold the job if it was requeued at a later time.

.TP
\fBnotify\fP \fIjob_id\fP \fImessage\fP
Send a message to standard error of the salloc or srun command or batch job
associated with the specified \fIjob_id\fP.

.TP
\fBpidinfo\fP \fIproc_id\fP
Print the Slurm job id and scheduled termination time corresponding to the
supplied process id, \fIproc_id\fP, on the current node.  This will work only
with processes on node on which scontrol is run, and only for those processes
spawned by Slurm and their descendants.

.TP
\fBlistpids\fP [\fIjob_id\fP[.\fIstep_id\fP]] [\fINodeName\fP]
Print a listing of the process IDs in a job step (if JOBID.STEPID is provided),
or all of the job steps in a job (if \fIjob_id\fP is provided), or all of the job
steps in all of the jobs on the local node (if \fIjob_id\fP is not provided
or \fIjob_id\fP is "*").  This will work only with processes on the node on
which scontrol is run, and only for those processes spawned by Slurm and
their descendants. Note that some Slurm configurations
(\fIProctrackType\fP value of \fIpgid\fP)
are unable to identify all processes associated with a job or job step.

Note that the NodeName option is only really useful when you have multiple
slurmd daemons running on the same host machine.  Multiple slurmd daemons on
one host are, in general, only used by Slurm developers.

.TP
\fBping\fP
Ping the primary and secondary slurmctld daemon and report if
they are responding.

.TP
\fBreboot\fP [ASAP] [\fINodeList\fP]
Reboot all nodes in the system when they become idle using the
\fBRebootProgram\fP as configured in Slurm's slurm.conf file.
The option "ASAP" prevents initiation of additional jobs so the node can be
rebooted and returned to service "As Soon As Possible" (i.e. ASAP).
Accepts an option list of nodes to reboot. By default all nodes are rebooted.
NOTE: This command does not prevent additional jobs from being scheduled on
these nodes, so many jobs can be executed on the nodes prior to them being
rebooted. You can explicitly drain the nodes in order to reboot nodes as soon
as possible, but the nodes must also explicitly be returned to service after
being rebooted. You can alternately create an advanced reservation to
prevent additional jobs from being initiated on nodes to be rebooted.
NOTE: Nodes will be placed in a state of "REBOOT" until rebooted and returned
to service with a normal state.
Alternately the node's state "REBOOT" may be cleared by using the scontrol
command to set the node state to "RESUME", which clears the "REBOOT" flag.

.TP
\fBreconfigure\fP
Instruct all Slurm daemons to re\-read the configuration file.
This command does not restart the daemons.
This mechanism would be used to modify configuration parameters (Epilog,
Prolog, SlurmctldLogFile, SlurmdLogFile, etc.).
The Slurm controller (slurmctld) forwards the request all other daemons
(slurmd daemon on each compute node). Running jobs continue execution.
Most configuration parameters can be changed by just running this command,
however, Slurm daemons should be shutdown and restarted if any of these
parameters are to be changed: AuthType, BackupAddr, BackupController,
ControlAddr, ControlMach, PluginDir, StateSaveLocation, SlurmctldPort
or SlurmdPort. The slurmctld daemon and all slurmd daemons must be
restarted if nodes are added to or removed from the cluster.

.TP
\fBrelease\fP \fIjob_list\fP
Release a previously held job to begin execution.
The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs OR
"jobname=" with the job's name, which will attempt to hold all jobs having
that name.
Also see \fBhold\fR.

.TP
\fBrequeue\fP \fIjob_list\fP
Requeue a running, suspended or finished Slurm batch job into pending state.
The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.

.TP
\fBrequeuehold\fP \fIjob_list\fP
Requeue a running, suspended or finished Slurm batch job into pending state,
moreover the job is put in held state (priority zero).
The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.
A held job can be released using scontrol to reset its priority (e.g.
"scontrol release <job_id>"). The command accepts the following option:
.RS
.TP
\fIState=SpecialExit\fP
The "SpecialExit" keyword specifies that the job
has to be put in a special state \fBJOB_SPECIAL_EXIT\fP.
The "scontrol show job" command will display the JobState as
\fBSPECIAL_EXIT\fP, while the "squeue" command as \fBSE\fP.
.RE

.TP
\fBresume\fP \fIjob_list\fP
Resume a previously suspended job.
The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.
Also see \fBsuspend\fR.

\fBNOTE:\fR A suspended job releases its CPUs for allocation to other jobs.
Resuming a previously suspended job may result in multiple jobs being
allocated the same CPUs, which could trigger gang scheduling with some
configurations or severe degradation in performance with other configurations.
Use of the scancel command to send SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals would stop a
job without releasing its CPUs for allocation to other jobs and would be a
preferable mechanism in many cases.
Use with caution.

.TP
\fBschedloglevel\fP \fILEVEL\fP
Enable or disable scheduler logging.
\fILEVEL\fP may be "0", "1", "disable" or "enable". "0" has the same
effect as "disable". "1" has the same effect as "enable".
This value is temporary and will be overwritten when the slurmctld
daemon reads the slurm.conf configuration file (e.g. when the daemon
is restarted or \fBscontrol reconfigure\fR is executed) if the
SlurmSchedLogLevel parameter is present.

.TP
\fBsetdebug\fP \fILEVEL\fP
Change the debug level of the slurmctld daemon.
\fILEVEL\fP may be an integer value between zero and nine (using the
same values as \fISlurmctldDebug\fP in the \fIslurm.conf\fP file) or
the name of the most detailed message type to be printed:
"quiet", "fatal", "error", "info", "verbose", "debug", "debug2", "debug3",
"debug4", or "debug5".
This value is temporary and will be overwritten whenever the slurmctld
daemon reads the slurm.conf configuration file (e.g. when the daemon
is restarted or \fBscontrol reconfigure\fR is executed).

.TP
\fBsetdebugflags\fP [+|\-]\fIFLAG\fP
Add or remove DebugFlags of the slurmctld daemon.
See "man slurm.conf" for a list of supported DebugFlags.
NOTE: Changing the value of some DebugFlags will have no effect without
restarting the slurmctld daemon, which would set DebugFlags based upon the
contents of the slurm.conf configuration file.

.TP
\fBshow\fP \fIENTITY\fP \fIID\fP
or
.TP
\fBshow\fP \fIENTITY\fP=\fIID\fP
Display the state of the specified entity with the specified identification.
\fIENTITY\fP may be \fIaliases\fP, \fIassoc_mgr\fP, \fIburstbuffer\fP,
\fIconfig\fP, \fIdaemons\fP, \fIfrontend\fP, \fIjob\fP, \fInode\fP,
\fIpartition\fP, \fIpowercap\fP, \fIreservation\fP, \fIslurmd\fP, \fIstep\fP,
\fItopology\fP, \fIhostlist\fP, \fIhostlistsorted\fP or \fIhostnames\fP
(also \fIblock\fP or \fIsubmp\fP on BlueGene systems).
\fIID\fP can be used to identify a specific element of the identified
entity: job ID, node name, partition name, reservation name, or job step ID for
\fIjob\fP, \fInode\fP, \fIpartition\fP, or \fIstep\fP respectively.
For an \fIENTITY\fP of \fItopology\fP, the \fIID\fP may be a node or switch name.
If one node name is specified, all switches connected to that node (and
their parent switches) will be shown.
If more than one node name is specified, only switches that connect to all
named nodes will be shown.
\fIaliases\fP will return all \fINodeName\fP values associated to a given
\fINodeHostname\fP (useful to get the list of virtual nodes associated with a
real node in a configuration where multiple slurmd daemons execute on a single
compute node).
\fIassoc_mgr\fP displays the current contents of the slurmctld's internal cache
for users, associations and/or qos. The \fIID\fP may be users=<user1>,[...,<userN>],
accounts=<acct1>,[...,<acctN>], qos=<qos1>,[...,<qosN>] and/or
flags=<users,assoc,qos>, used to filter the desired section to be displayed. If
no flags are specified, all sections are displayed.
\fIburstbuffer\fP displays the current status of the BurstBuffer plugin.
\fIconfig\fP displays parameter names from the configuration files in mixed
case (e.g. SlurmdPort=7003) while derived parameters names are in upper case
only (e.g. SLURM_VERSION).
\fIhostnames\fP takes an optional hostlist expression as input and
writes a list of individual host names to standard output (one per
line). If no hostlist expression is supplied, the contents of the
SLURM_NODELIST environment variable is used. For example "tux[1\-3]"
is mapped to "tux1","tux2" and "tux3" (one hostname per line).
\fIhostlist\fP takes a list of host names and prints the hostlist
expression for them (the inverse of \fIhostnames\fP).
\fIhostlist\fP can also take the absolute pathname of a file
(beginning with the character '/') containing a list of hostnames.
Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions
(e.g. "lx[10\-20]"). All other \fIID\fP values must identify a single
element. The job step ID is of the form "job_id.step_id", (e.g. "1234.1").
\fIslurmd\fP reports the current status of the slurmd daemon executing
on the same node from which the scontrol command is executed (the
local host). It can be useful to diagnose problems.
By default \fIhostlist\fP does not sort the node list or make it
unique (e.g. tux2,tux1,tux2 = tux[2,1-2]).  If you wanted a sorted
list use \fIhostlistsorted\fP (e.g. tux2,tux1,tux2 = tux[1-2,2]).
By default, all elements of the entity type specified are printed.
For an \fIENTITY\fP of \fIjob\fP, if the job does not specify
socket-per-node, cores-per-socket or threads-per-core then it
will display '*' in ReqS:C:T=*:*:* field.

.TP
\fBshutdown\fP \fIOPTION\fP
Instruct Slurm daemons to save current state and terminate.
By default, the Slurm controller (slurmctld) forwards the request all
other daemons (slurmd daemon on each compute node).
An \fIOPTION\fP of \fIslurmctld\fP or \fIcontroller\fP results in
only the slurmctld daemon being shutdown and the slurmd daemons
remaining active.

.TP
\fBsuspend\fP \fIjob_list\fP
Suspend a running job.
The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.
Use the \fIresume\fP command to resume its execution.
User processes must stop on receipt of SIGSTOP signal and resume
upon receipt of SIGCONT for this operation to be effective.
Not all architectures and configurations support job suspension.
If a suspended job is requeued, it will be placed in a held state.

.TP
\fBtakeover\fP
Instruct Slurm's backup controller (slurmctld) to take over system control.
Slurm's backup controller requests control from the primary and waits for
its termination. After that, it switches from backup mode to controller
mode. If primary controller can not be contacted, it directly switches to
controller mode. This can be used to speed up the Slurm controller
fail\-over mechanism when the primary node is down.
This can be used to minimize disruption if the computer executing the
primary Slurm controller is scheduled down.
(Note: Slurm's primary controller will take the control back at startup.)

.TP
\fBtop\fP \fIjob_id\fP
Move the specified job ID to the top of the queue of jobs belonging to the
identical user ID, partition name, account, and QOS.
Any job not matching \fBall\fP of those fields will not be effected.
Only jobs submitted to a single partition will be effected.
This operation changes the order of jobs by adjusting job nice values.
The net effect on that user's throughput will be negligible to slightly negative.
This operation may be disabled by the system administrator by including the
option "disable_user_top" in the SchedulerParameters configuration parameter.

.TP
\fBuhold\fP \fIjob_list\fP
Prevent a pending job from being started (sets it's priority to 0).
The job_list argument is a space separated list of job IDs or job names.
Use the \fIrelease\fP command to permit the job to be scheduled.
This command is designed for a system administrator to hold a job so that
the job owner may release it rather than requiring the intervention of a
system administrator (also see the \fBhold\fP command).

.TP
\fBupdate\fP \fISPECIFICATION\fP
Update job, step, node, partition, powercapping or reservation configuration per
the supplied specification. \fISPECIFICATION\fP is in the same format as the
Slurm configuration file and the output of the \fIshow\fP command described 
above. It may be desirable to execute the \fIshow\fP command (described above)
on the specific entity you want to update, then use cut\-and\-paste tools to
enter updated configuration values to the \fIupdate\fP. Note that while most
configuration values can be changed using this command, not all can be changed
using this mechanism. In particular, the hardware configuration of a node or
the physical addition or removal of nodes from the cluster may only be
accomplished through editing the Slurm configuration file and executing
the \fIreconfigure\fP command (described above).

.TP
\fBversion\fP
Display the version number of scontrol being executed.

.TP
\fBwait_job\fP \fIjob_id\fP
Wait until a job and all of its nodes are ready for use or the job has entered
some termination state. This option is particularly useful in the Slurm Prolog
or in the batch script itself if nodes are powered down and restarted
automatically as needed.

.TP
\fBwrite config\fP
Write the current configuration to a file with the naming convention of
"slurm.conf.<datetime>" in the same directory as the original slurm.conf
file.

.TP
\fBINTERACTIVE COMMANDS\fR
\fBNOTE:\fP
All commands listed below can be used in the interactive mode, but \fINOT\fP
on the initial command line.

.TP
\fBall\fP
Show all partitions, their jobs and jobs steps. This causes information to be
displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that
are unavailable to user's group.

.TP
\fBdetails\fP
Causes the \fIshow\fP command to provide additional details where available.
Job information will include CPUs and NUMA memory allocated on each node.
Note that on computers with hyperthreading enabled and Slurm configured to
allocate cores, each listed CPU represents one physical core.
Each hyperthread on that core can be allocated a separate task, so a job's
CPU count and task count may differ.
See the \fB\-\-cpu_bind\fR and \fB\-\-mem_bind\fR option descriptions in
srun man pages for more information.
The \fBdetails\fP option is currently only supported for the \fIshow job\fP
command. To also list the batch script for batch jobs, in addition to the
details, use the \fBscript\fP option described below instead of this option.

.TP
\fBexit\fP
Terminate scontrol interactive session.

.TP
\fBhide\fP
Do not display partition, job or jobs step information for partitions that are
configured as hidden or partitions that are unavailable to the user's group.
This is the default behavior.

.TP
\fBoneliner\fP
Print information one line per record.

.TP
\fBquiet\fP
Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.

.TP
\fBquit\fP
Terminate the execution of scontrol.

.TP
\fBscript\fP
Causes the \fIshow job\fP command to list the batch script for batch
jobs in addition to the detail information described under the
\fBdetails\fP option above.

.TP
\fBverbose\fP
Print detailed event logging.
This includes time\-stamps on data structures, record counts, etc.

.TP
\fB!!\fP
Repeat the last command executed.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND, JOBS\fR
.LP
Note that update requests done by either root, SlurmUser or Administrators are
not subject to certain restrictions. For instance, if an Administrator changes
the QOS on a pending job, certain limits such as the TimeLimit will not be
changed automatically as changes made by the Administrators are allowed to
violate these restrictions.

.TP
\fIAccount\fP=<account>
Account name to be changed for this job's resource use.
Value may be cleared with blank data value, "Account=".
.TP
\fIAdminComment\fP=<spec> OR +=<spec>
Arbitrary descriptive string. Can only be set by a Slurm administrator.
Use "+=" syntax to append information.
.TP
\fIArrayTaskThrottle\fP=<count>
Specify the maximum number of tasks in a job array that can execute at
the same time.
Set the count to zero in order to eliminate any limit.
The task throttle count for a job array is reported as part of its ArrayTaskId
field, preceded with a percent sign.
For example "ArrayTaskId=1\-10%2" indicates the maximum number of running tasks
is limited to 2.
.TP
\fIBurstBuffer\fP=<spec>
Burst buffer specification to be changed for this job's resource use.
Value may be cleared with blank data value, "BurstBuffer=".
Format is burst buffer plugin specific.
.TP
\fIComment\fP=<spec>
Arbitrary descriptive string.
.TP
\fIConn\-Type\fP=<type>
Reset the node connection type. Supported only on IBM BlueGene systems.
Possible values on are "MESH", "TORUS" and "NAV" (mesh else torus).
.TP
\fIContiguous\fP=<yes|no>
Set the job's requirement for contiguous (consecutive) nodes to be allocated.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
Only the Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.
.TP
\fIDeadline\fP=<time_spec>
It accepts times of the form \fIHH:MM:SS\fR to specify a deadline to a job at
a specific time of day (seconds are optional).
You may also specify \fImidnight\fR, \fInoon\fR, \fIfika\fR (3 PM) or
\fIteatime\fR (4 PM) and you can have a time\-of\-day suffixed
with \fIAM\fR or \fIPM\fR for a deadline in the morning or the evening.
You can specify a deadline for the job with
a date of the form \fIMMDDYY\fR or \fIMM/DD/YY\fR or \fIMM.DD.YY\fR,
or a date and time as \fIYYYY\-MM\-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]\fR.  You can also
give times like \fInow + count time\-units\fR, where the time\-units
can be \fIminutes\fR, \fIhours\fR, \fIdays\fR, or \fIweeks\fR
and you can tell Slurm to put a deadline for tomorrow with the keyword
\fItomorrow\fR.
The specified deadline must be later than the current time.
Only pending jobs can have the deadline updated.
Only the Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.
.TP
\fIDependency\fP=<dependency_list>
Defer job's initiation until specified job dependency specification
is satisfied.
Cancel dependency with an empty dependency_list (e.g. "Dependency=").
<\fIdependency_list\fR> is of the form
<\fItype:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]\fR>.
Many jobs can share the same dependency and these jobs may even belong to
different  users.
.PD
.RS
.TP
\fBafter:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have begun
execution.
.TP
\fBafterany:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.
.TP
\fBafternotok:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated
in some failed state (non-zero exit code, node failure, timed out, etc).
.TP
\fBafterok:job_id[:jobid...]\fR
This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully
executed (ran to completion with an exit code of zero).
.TP
\fBsingleton\fR
This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs
sharing the same job name and user have terminated.
.RE
.TP
\fIEligibleTime\fP=<time_spec>
See \fIStartTime\fP.
.TP
\fIExcNodeList\fP=<nodes>
Set the job's list of excluded node. Multiple node names may be
specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10\-20]").
Value may be cleared with blank data value, "ExcNodeList=".
.TP
\fIFeatures\fP=<features>
Set the job's required node features.
The list of features may include multiple feature names separated
by ampersand (AND) and/or vertical bar (OR) operators.
For example: \fBFeatures="opteron&video"\fR or \fBFeatures="fast|faster"\fR.
In the first example, only nodes having both the feature "opteron" AND
the feature "video" will be used.
There is no mechanism to specify that you want one node with feature
"opteron" and another node with feature "video" in case no
node has both features.
If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated
nodes, then use the OR operator and enclose the options within square brackets.
For example: "\fBFeatures=[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]"\fR might
be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a single rack of
the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.
A request can also specify the number of nodes needed with some feature
by appending an asterisk and count after the feature name.
For example "\fBFeatures=graphics*4"\fR
indicates that at least four allocated nodes must have the feature "graphics."
Constraints with node counts may only be combined with AND operators.
Value may be cleared with blank data value, for example "Features=".

.TP
\fIGeometry\fP=<geo>
Reset the required job geometry.
On Blue Gene the value should be three digits separated by
"x" or ",". The digits represent the allocation size in
X, Y and Z dimensions (e.g. "2x3x4").

.TP
\fIGres\fP=<list>
Specifies a comma delimited list of generic consumable resources.
The format of each entry on the list is "name[:count[*cpu]]".
The name is that of the consumable resource.
The count is the number of those resources with a default value of 1.
The specified resources will be allocated to the job on each node
allocated unless "*cpu" is appended, in which case the resources
will be allocated on a per cpu basis.
The available generic consumable resources is configurable by the system
administrator.
A list of available generic consumable resources will be printed and the
command will exit if the option argument is "help".
Examples of use include "Gres=gpus:2*cpu,disk=40G" and "Gres=help".

.TP
\fIJobId\fP=<job_list>
Identify the job(s) to be updated.
The job_list may be a comma separated list of job IDs.
Either \fIJobId\fP or \fIJobName\fP is required.
.TP
\fILicenses\fP=<name>
Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes
of the cluster) as described in salloc/sbatch/srun man pages.
.TP
\fIMinCPUsNode\fP=<count>
Set the job's minimum number of CPUs per node to the specified value.
.TP
\fIMinMemoryCPU\fP=<megabytes>
Set the job's minimum real memory required per allocated CPU to the specified
value. Either \fIMinMemoryCPU\fP or \fIMinMemoryNode\fP may be set, but not both.
.TP
\fIMinMemoryNode\fP=<megabytes>
Set the job's minimum real memory required per node to the specified value.
Either \fIMinMemoryCPU\fP or \fIMinMemoryNode\fP may be set, but not both.
.TP
\fIMinTmpDiskNode\fP=<megabytes>
Set the job's minimum temporary disk space required per node to the specified value.
Only the Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.
.TP
\fIJobName\fP=<name>
Identify the name of jobs to be modified or set the job's name to the
specified value.
When used to identify jobs to be modified, all jobs belonging to all users
are modified unless the \fIUserID\fP option is used to identify a specific user.
Either \fIJobId\fP or \fIJobName\fP is required.
.TP
\fB\-\-nice\fR[=\fIadjustment\fR]
Update the job with an adjusted scheduling priority within Slurm. With no
adjustment value the scheduling priority is decreased by 100. A negative nice
value increases the priority, otherwise decreases it. The adjustment range is
+/\- 2147483645. Only privileged users can specify a negative adjustment.
.TP
\fINodeList\fP=<nodes>
Change the nodes allocated to a running job to shrink it's size.
The specified list of nodes must be a subset of the nodes currently
allocated to the job. Multiple node names may be specified using
simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10\-20]"). After a job's allocation
is reduced, subsequent \fBsrun\fR commands must explicitly specify node and
task counts which are valid for the new allocation.
.TP
\fINumCPUs\fP=<min_count>[\-<max_count>]
Set the job's minimum and optionally maximum count of CPUs to be allocated.
.TP
\fINumNodes\fP=<min_count>[\-<max_count>]
Set the job's minimum and optionally maximum count of nodes to be allocated.
If the job is already running, use this to specify a node count less than
currently allocated and resources previously allocated to the job will be
relinquished. After a job's allocation is reduced, subsequent \fBsrun\fR
commands must explicitly specify node and task counts which are valid for the
new allocation. Also see the \fINodeList\fP parameter above.
.TP
\fINumTasks\fP=<count>
Set the job's count of required tasks to the specified value.
.TP
\fIOverSubscribe\fP=<yes|no>
Set the job's ability to share compute resources (i.e. individual CPUs)
with other jobs. Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
This option can only be changed for pending jobs.
.TP
\fIPartition\fP=<name>
Set the job's partition to the specified value.
.TP
\fIPriority\fP=<number>
Set the job's priority to the specified value.
Note that a job priority of zero prevents the job from ever being scheduled.
By setting a job's priority to zero it is held.
Set the priority to a non\-zero value to permit it to run.
Explicitly setting a job's priority clears any previously set nice value and
removes the priority/multifactor plugin's ability to manage a job's priority.
In order to restore the priority/multifactor plugin's ability to manage a
job's priority, hold and then release the job.
Only the Slurm administrator or root can increase job's priority.
.TP
\fIQOS\fP=<name>
Set the job's QOS (Quality Of Service) to the specified value.
Value may be cleared with blank data value, "QOS=".
.TP
\fIReqNodeList\fP=<nodes>

Stipulates whether a job should be requeued after a node failure: 0
for no, 1 for yes.
.TP
\fIReservationName\fP=<name>
Set the job's reservation to the specified value.
Value may be cleared with blank data value, "ReservationName=".
.TP
\fIRotate\fP=<yes|no>
Permit the job's geometry to be rotated.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
.TP
\fIShared\fP=<yes|no>
See \fIOverSubscribe\fP option above.
.TP
\fIStartTime\fP=<time_spec>
Set the job's earliest initiation time.
It accepts times of the form \fIHH:MM:SS\fR to run a job at
a specific time of day (seconds are optional).
(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)
You may also specify \fImidnight\fR, \fInoon\fR, \fIfika\fR (3 PM) or
\fIteatime\fR (4 PM) and you can have a time\-of\-day suffixed
with \fIAM\fR or \fIPM\fR for running in the morning or the evening.
You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying
a date of the form \fIMMDDYY\fR or \fIMM/DD/YY\fR or \fIMM.DD.YY\fR,
or a date and time as \fIYYYY\-MM\-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]\fR.  You can also
give times like \fInow + count time\-units\fR, where the time\-units
can be \fIminutes\fR, \fIhours\fR, \fIdays\fR, or \fIweeks\fR
and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword
\fItoday\fR and to run the job tomorrow with the keyword
\fItomorrow\fR.
.RS
.PP
Notes on date/time specifications:
 \- although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is
allowed by the code, note that the poll time of the Slurm scheduler
is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of the job on the exact
second.  The job will be eligible to start on the next poll
following the specified time. The exact poll interval depends on the
Slurm scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default sched/builtin).
 \- if no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
 \- if a date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current
year is assumed, unless the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has
already passed for that year, in which case the next year is used.
.RE
.TP
\fISwitches\fP=<count>[@<max\-time\-to\-wait>]
When a tree topology is used, this defines the maximum count of switches
desired for the job allocation. If Slurm finds an allocation containing more
switches than the count specified, the job remain pending until it either finds
an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires. By default
there is no switch count limit and no time limit delay. Set the count
to zero in order to clean any previously set count (disabling the limit).
The job's maximum time delay may be limited by the system administrator using
the \fBSchedulerParameters\fR configuration parameter with the
\fBmax_switch_wait\fR parameter option.
Also see \fIwait\-for\-switch\fP.

.TP
\fITimeLimit\fP=<time>
The job's time limit.
Output format is [days\-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".
Input format (for \fBupdate\fR command) set is minutes, minutes:seconds,
hours:minutes:seconds, days\-hours, days\-hours:minutes or
days\-hours:minutes:seconds.
Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to
the next minute.
If changing the time limit of a job, either specify a new time limit value or
precede the time with a "+" or "\-" to increment or decrement the current
time limit (e.g. "TimeLimit=+30"). In order to increment or decrement the
current time limit, the \fIJobId\fP specification must precede the
\fITimeLimit\fP specification.
Only the Slurm administrator or root can increase job's TimeLimit.

.TP
\fIUserID\fP=<UID or name>
Used with the \fIJobName\fP option to identify jobs to be modified.
Either a user name or numeric ID (UID), may be specified.

.TP
\fIWCKey\fP=<key>
Set the job's workload characterization key to the specified value.

.TP
NOTE: The "show" command, when used with the "job" or "job <jobid>"
entity displays detailed information about a job or jobs.  Much of
this information may be modified using the "update job" command as
described above.  However, the following fields displayed by the show
job command are read\-only and cannot be modified:

.TP
\fIAllocNode:Sid\fP
Local node and system id making the resource allocation.
.TP
\fIBatchFlag\fP
Jobs submitted using the sbatch command have BatchFlag set to 1.
Jobs submitted using other commands have BatchFlag set to 0.
.TP
\fICoreSpec\fP=<count>
Number of cores to reserve per node for system use.
The job will be charged for these cores, but be unable to use them.
Will be reported as "*" if not constrained.
.TP
\fIEndTime\fP
The time the job is expected to terminate based on the job's time
limit.  When the job ends sooner, this field will be updated with the
actual end time.
.TP
\fIExitCode\fP=<exit>:<sig>
Exit status reported for the job by the wait() function.
The first number is the exit code, typically as set by the exit() function.
The second number of the signal that caused the process to terminate if
it was terminated by a signal.
.TP
\fIGroupId\fP
The group under which the job was submitted.
.TP
\fIJobState\fP
The current state of the job.
.TP
\fINodeList\fP
The list of nodes allocated to the job.
.TP
\fINodeListIndices\fP
The NodeIndices expose the internal indices into the node table
associated with the node(s) allocated to the job.
.TP
.na
\fINtasksPerN:B:S:C\fP=
<tasks_per_node>:<tasks_per_baseboard>:<tasks_per_socket>:<tasks_per_core>
Specifies the number of tasks to be started per hardware component (node,
baseboard, socket and core).
Unconstrained values may be shown as "0" or "*".
.ad
.TP
\fIPreemptTime\fP
Time at which job was signaled that it was selected for preemption.
(Meaningful only for PreemptMode=CANCEL and the partition or QOS
with which the job is associated has a GraceTime value designated.)
.TP
\fIPreSusTime\fP
Time the job ran prior to last suspend.
.TP
\fIReason\fP
The reason job is not running: e.g., waiting "Resources".
.TP
.na
\fIReqB:S:C:T\fP=
<baseboard_count>:<socket_per_baseboard_count>:<core_per_socket_count>:<thread_per_core_count>
Specifies the count of various hardware components requested by the job.
Unconstrained values may be shown as "0" or "*".
.ad
.TP
\fISecsPreSuspend\fP=<seconds>
If the job is suspended, this is the run time accumulated by the job
(in seconds) prior to being suspended.
.TP
\fISocks/Node\fP=<count>
Count of desired sockets per node
.TP
\fISubmitTime\fP
The time  and  date stamp (in Universal Time Coordinated, UTC)
the job was submitted.  The format of the output is identical
to that of the EndTime field.

NOTE: If a job is requeued, the submit time is reset.
To obtain the original submit time it is necessary
to use the "sacct \-j <job_id[.<step_id>]" command also
designating the \-D or \-\-duplicate option to display all
duplicate entries for a job.
.TP
\fISuspendTime\fP
Time the job was last suspended or resumed.
.TP
\fIUserId\fP
The user under which the job was submitted.
.TP
NOTE on information displayed for various job states:
When you submit a request for the "show job" function the scontrol
process makes an RPC request call to slurmctld with a REQUEST_JOB_INFO
message type.  If the state of the job is PENDING, then it returns
some detail information such as: min_nodes, min_procs, cpus_per_task,
etc. If the state is other than PENDING the code assumes that it is in
a further state such as RUNNING, COMPLETE, etc. In these cases the
code explicitly returns zero for these values. These values are
meaningless once the job resources have been allocated and the job has
started.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND, STEPS\fR
.TP
\fIStepId\fP=<job_id>[.<step_id>]
Identify the step to be updated.
If the job_id is given, but no step_id is specified then all steps of

Input format (for \fBupdate\fR command) set is minutes, minutes:seconds,
hours:minutes:seconds, days\-hours, days\-hours:minutes or
days\-hours:minutes:seconds.
Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to
the next minute.
If changing the time limit of a step, either specify a new time limit value or
precede the time with a "+" or "\-" to increment or decrement the current
time limit (e.g. "TimeLimit=+30"). In order to increment or decrement the
current time limit, the \fIStepId\fP specification must precede the
\fITimeLimit\fP specification.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND, NODES\fR
.TP
\fINodeName\fP=<name>
Identify the node(s) to be updated. Multiple node names may be specified using
simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10\-20]"). This specification is required.

.TP
\fIActiveFeatures\fP=<features>
Identify the feature(s) currently active on the specified node.
Any previously active feature specification will be overwritten with the new
value.
Also see \fIAvailableFeatures\fP.
Typically \fIActiveFeatures\fP will be identical to \fIAvailableFeatures\fP;
however \fIActiveFeatures\fP may be configured as a subset of the
\fIAvailableFeatures\fP. For example, a node may be booted in multiple
configurations. In that case, all possible configurations may be identified as
\fIAvailableFeatures\fP, while \fIActiveFeatures\fP would identify the current
node configuration.

.TP
\fIAvailableFeatures\fP=<features>
Identify the feature(s) available on the specified node.
Any previously defined available feature specification will be overwritten with
the new value.
AvailableFeatures assigned via \fBscontrol\fR will only persist across the
restart of the slurmctld daemon with the \fI\-R\fR option and state files
preserved or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.
Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to be persistent across normal
restarts of slurmctld or the execution of \fBscontrol reconfig\fR.
Also see \fIActiveFeatures\fP.

.TP
\fIGres\fP=<gres>
Identify generic resources to be associated with the specified node.  Any
previously defined generic resources will be overwritten with the new value.
Specifications for multiple generic resources should be comma separated.
Each resource specification consists of a name followed by an optional
colon with a numeric value (default value is one)
(e.g. "Gres=bandwidth:10000,gpus").
Generic resources assigned via \fBscontrol\fR will only persist across the
restart of the slurmctld daemon with the \fI\-R\fR option and state files
preserved or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.
Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to be persistent across normal
restarts of slurmctld or the execution of \fBscontrol reconfig\fR.

.TP
\fIReason\fP=<reason>
Identify the reason the node is in a "DOWN", "DRAINED", "DRAINING",
"FAILING" or "FAIL" state.
Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.

.TP
\fIState\fP=<state>
Identify the state to be assigned to the node. Possible node states are "NoResp",
"ALLOC", "ALLOCATED", "COMPLETING", "DOWN", "DRAIN", "ERROR, "FAIL", "FAILING",
"FUTURE" "IDLE", "MAINT", "MIXED", "PERFCTRS/NPC", "RESERVED", "POWER_DOWN",
"POWER_UP", "RESUME" or "UNDRAIN". Not all of those states can be set using
the scontrol command only the following can: "NoResp", "DRAIN", "FAIL",
"FUTURE", "RESUME", "POWER_DOWN", "POWER_UP" and "UNDRAIN".
If a node is in a "MIXED" state it usually means the node is in
multiple states.  For instance if only part of the node is "ALLOCATED"
and the rest of the node is "IDLE" the state will be "MIXED".
If you want to remove a node from service, you typically want to set
it's state to "DRAIN".
"FAILING" is similar to "DRAIN" except that some applications will
seek to relinquish those nodes before the job completes.
"PERFCTRS/NPC" indicates that Network Performance Counters associated with this
node are in use, rendering this node as not usable for any other jobs.
"RESERVED" indicates the node is in an advanced reservation and not generally
available.
"RESUME" is not an actual node state, but will change a node state from
"DRAINED", "DRAINING", "DOWN", "MAINT" or "REBOOT" to either
"IDLE" or "ALLOCATED" state as appropriate.
"UNDRAIN" clears the node from being drained (like "RESUME"), but will
not change the node's base state (e.g. "DOWN").
Setting a node "DOWN" will cause all running and suspended jobs on that
node to be terminated.
"POWER_DOWN" and "POWER_UP" will use the configured \fISuspendProg\fR and
\fIResumeProg\fR programs to explicitly place a node in or out of a power
saving mode. If a node is already in the process of being powered up or down,
the command will have no effect until the configured ResumeTimeout or
SuspendTimeout is reached.
The "NoResp" state will only set the "NoResp" flag for a node without
changing its underlying state.
While all of the above states are valid, some of them are not valid new
node states given their prior state.
If the node state code printed is followed by "~", this indicates
the node is presently in a power saving mode (typically
running at reduced frequency).
If the node state code is followed by "#", this indicates
the node is presently being powered up or configured.
If the node state code is followed by "$", this indicates
the node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance".
If the node state code is followed by "@", this indicates
the node is currently scheduled to be rebooted.
Generally only "DRAIN", "FAIL" and "RESUME" should be used.
NOTE: The scontrol command should not be used to change node state on Cray
systems. Use Cray tools such as \fIxtprocadmin\fR instead.

.TP
\fIWeight\fP=<weight>
Identify weight to be associated with specified nodes. This allows
dynamic changes to weight associated with nodes, which will be used
for the subsequent node allocation decisions.
Weight assigned via \fBscontrol\fR will only persist across the restart
of the slurmctld daemon with the \fI\-R\fR option and state files
preserved or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.
Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to be persistent across normal
restarts of slurmctld or the execution of \fBscontrol reconfig\fR.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND, FRONTEND\fR

.TP
\fIFrontendName\fP=<name>
Identify the front end node to be updated. This specification is required.

.TP
\fIReason\fP=<reason>
Identify the reason the node is in a "DOWN" or "DRAIN" state.
Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.

.TP
\fIState\fP=<state>
Identify the state to be assigned to the front end node. Possible values are
"DOWN", "DRAIN" or "RESUME".
If you want to remove a front end node from service, you typically want to set
it's state to "DRAIN".
"RESUME" is not an actual node state, but will return a "DRAINED", "DRAINING",
or "DOWN" front end node to service, either "IDLE" or "ALLOCATED" state as
appropriate.
Setting a front end node "DOWN" will cause all running and suspended jobs on
that node to be terminated.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR CREATE, UPDATE, AND DELETE COMMANDS, PARTITIONS\fR

use the scontrol update command and set Default=yes for the partition
that you want to become the new default.

.TP
\fIDefaultTime\fP=<time>
Run time limit used for jobs that don't specify a value. If not set
then MaxTime will be used.
Format is the same as for MaxTime.

have already begun execution.

.TP
\fIMaxTime\fP=<time>
The maximum run time for jobs.
Output format is [days\-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".
Input format (for \fBupdate\fR command) is minutes, minutes:seconds,
hours:minutes:seconds, days\-hours, days\-hours:minutes or
days\-hours:minutes:seconds.
Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to
the next minute.
Changing the \fIMaxTime\fP of a partition has no effect upon jobs that
have already begun execution.

.TP
\fIMinNodes\fP=<count>
Set the minimum number of nodes which will be allocated to any single job
in the partition.   (On a Bluegene type system this represents a c\-node count.)
Changing the \fIMinNodes\fP of a partition has no effect upon jobs that
have already begun execution.

.TP
\fINodes\fP=<name>
Identify the node(s) to be associated with this partition. Multiple node names
may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10\-20]").
Note that jobs may only be associated with one partition at any time.
Specify a blank data value to remove all nodes from a partition: "Nodes=".
Changing the \fINodes\fP in a partition has no effect upon jobs that
have already begun execution.

.TP
\fIOverTimeLimit\fP=<count>
Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before
being canceled.
The configured job time limit is treated as a \fIsoft\fR limit.
Adding \fBOverTimeLimit\fR to the \fIsoft\fR limit provides a \fIhard\fR
limit, at which point the job is canceled.
This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon
each job's soft time limit.
A partition\-specific \fIOverTimeLimit\fP will override any global
\fIOverTimeLimit\fP value.
If not specified, the global \fIOverTimeLimit\fP value will take precedence.
May not exceed exceed 65533 minutes.
An input value of "UNLIMITED" will clear any previously configured
partition\-specific \fIOverTimeLimit\fP value.

.TP
\fIOverSubscribe\fP=<yes|no|exclusive|force>[:<job_count>]
Specify if compute resources (i.e. individual CPUs) in this partition can be

\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND, POWERCAP\fR

.TP
\fIPowerCap\fP=<count>
Set the amount of watts the cluster is limited to.
Specify a number, "INFINITE" to enable the power capping logic without
power restriction or "0" to disable the power capping logic.
Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to be persistent across normal
restarts of slurmctld or the execution of \fBscontrol reconfig\fR.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR CREATE, UPDATE, AND DELETE COMMANDS, RESERVATIONS\fR
.TP

.TP
\fIReservation\fP=<name>
Identify the name of the reservation to be created, updated, or deleted.
This parameter is required for update and is the only parameter for delete.
For create, if you do not want to give a reservation name, use
"scontrol create res ..." and a name will be created automatically.

.TP
\fIAccounts\fP=<account list>
List of accounts permitted to use the reserved nodes, for example
"Accounts=physcode1,physcode2".
A user in any of the accounts may use the reserved nodes.
A new reservation must specify Users and/or Accounts.
If both Users and Accounts are specified, a job must match both in order to
use the reservation.
Accounts can also be denied access to reservations by preceding all of the
account names with '\-'. Alternately precede the equal sign with '\-'.
For example, "Accounts=-physcode1,-physcode2" or "Accounts-=physcode1,physcode2"
will permit any account except physcode1 and physcode2 to use the reservation.
You can add or remove individual accounts from an existing reservation by
using the update command and adding a '+' or '\-' sign before the '=' sign.
If accounts are denied access to a reservation (account name preceded by a '\-'),
then all other accounts are implicitly allowed to use the reservation and it is
not possible to also explicitly specify allowed accounts.

.TP
\fIBurstBuffer\fP=<buffer_spec>[,<buffer_spec>,...]
Specification of burst buffer resources which are to be reserved.
"buffer_spec" consists of four elements:
[plugin:][type:]#[units]
"plugin" is the burst buffer plugin name, currently either "cray" or "generic".
If no plugin is specified, the reservation applies to all configured burst
buffer plugins.
"type" specifies a Cray generic burst buffer resource, for example "nodes".
if "type" is not specified, the number is a measure of storage space.
The "units" may be "N" (nodes), "K|KiB", "M|MiB", "G|GiB", "T|TiB", "P|PiB"
(for powers of 1024) and "KB", "MB", "GB", "TB", "PB" (for powers of 1000).
The default units are bytes for reservations of storage space.
For example "BurstBuffer=cray:2TB" (reserve 2TB of storage plus
3 nodes from the Cray plugin) or
"BurstBuffer=100GB" (reserve 100 GB of storage from all configured burst buffer
plugins).
Jobs using this reservation are not restricted to these burst buffer resources,
but may use these reserved resources plus any which are generally available.
NOTE: Usually Slurm interprets KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, TB units as powers of 1024,
but for Burst Buffers size specifications Slurm supports both IEC/SI formats.
This is because the CRAY API for managing DataWarps supports both formats.

.TP
\fICoreCnt\fP=<num>
This option is only supported when SelectType=select/cons_res. Identify number of
cores to be reserved. If NodeCnt is used, this is the total number of cores to
reserve where cores per node is CoreCnt/NodeCnt. If a nodelist is used, this
should be an array of core numbers by node: Nodes=node[1\-5] CoreCnt=2,2,3,3,4

.TP
\fILicenses\fP=<license>
Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all
nodes of the cluster) which are to be reserved.
License names can be followed by a colon and count
(the default count is one).
Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g. "Licenses=foo:4,bar").
A new reservation must specify one or more resource to be included: NodeCnt,
Nodes and/or Licenses.
If a reservation includes Licenses, but no NodeCnt or Nodes, then the option
\fIFlags=LICENSE_ONLY\fP must also be specified.
Jobs using this reservation are not restricted to these licenses, but may
use these reserved licenses plus any which are generally available.

.TP
\fINodeCnt\fP=<num>[,num,...]
Identify number of nodes to be reserved. The number can include a suffix of
"k" or "K", in which case the number specified is multiplied by 1024.
On BlueGene systems, this number represents a c\-node (compute node) count and
will be rounded up as needed to reserve whole nodes (midplanes).
In order to optimize the topology of the resource allocation on a new
reservation (not on an updated reservation), specific sizes
required for the reservation may be specified. For example, if you want to
reserve 4096 c\-nodes on a BlueGene system that can be used to allocate two
jobs each with 2048 c\-nodes, specify "NodeCnt=2k,2k".
A new reservation must specify one or more resource to be included: NodeCnt,
Nodes and/or Licenses.

.TP
\fINodes\fP=<name>
Identify the node(s) to be reserved. Multiple node names
may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "Nodes=lx[10\-20]").
Specify a blank data value to remove all nodes from a reservation: "Nodes=".
A new reservation must specify one or more resource to be included: NodeCnt,
Nodes and/or Licenses. A specification of "ALL" will reserve all nodes. Set
\fIFlags=PART_NODES\fP and \fIPartitionName=\fP in order for changes in the
nodes associated with a partition to also be reflected in the nodes associated
with a reservation.

.TP
\fIStartTime\fP=<time_spec>
The start time for the reservation.  A new reservation must specify a start
time.  It accepts times of the form \fIHH:MM:SS\fR for
a specific time of day (seconds are optional).
(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)
You may also specify \fImidnight\fR, \fInoon\fR, \fIfika\fR (3 PM) or
\fIteatime\fR (4 PM) and you can have a time\-of\-day suffixed
with \fIAM\fR or \fIPM\fR for running in the morning or the evening.
You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying
a date of the form \fIMMDDYY\fR or \fIMM/DD/YY\fR or \fIMM.DD.YY\fR,
or a date and time as \fIYYYY\-MM\-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]\fR.  You can also
give times like \fInow + count time\-units\fR, where the time\-units
can be \fIminutes\fR, \fIhours\fR, \fIdays\fR, or \fIweeks\fR
and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword
\fItoday\fR and to run the job tomorrow with the keyword
\fItomorrow\fR. You cannot update the \fIStartTime\fP of a reservation
in \fIACTIVE\fP state.

.TP
\fIEndTime\fP=<time_spec>
The end time for the reservation.  A new reservation must specify an end
time or a duration.  Valid formats are the same as for StartTime.

.TP
\fIDuration\fP=<time>
The length of a reservation.  A new reservation must specify an end
time or a duration.  Valid formats are minutes, minutes:seconds,
hours:minutes:seconds, days\-hours, days\-hours:minutes,
days\-hours:minutes:seconds, or UNLIMITED.  Time resolution is one minute and
second values are rounded up to the next minute. Output format is always
[days\-]hours:minutes:seconds.

.TP
\fIPartitionName\fP=<name>
Identify the partition to be reserved.

.TP
\fIFlags\fP=<flags>
Flags associated with the reservation.
You can add or remove individual flags from an existing reservation by
adding a '+' or '\-' sign before the '=' sign.  For example:
Flags\-=DAILY (NOTE: this shortcut is not supported for all flags).
Currently supported flags include:
.RS
.TP 14
\fIANY_NODES\fR
This is a reservation for burst buffers and/or licenses only and not compute
nodes.
If this flag is set, a job using this reservation may use the associated
burst buffers and/or licenses plus any compute nodes.
If this flag is not set, a job using this reservation may use only the nodes
and licenses associated with the reservation.
.TP
\fIDAILY\fR
Repeat the reservation at the same time every day
.TP
\fIFIRST_CORES\fR
Use the lowest numbered cores on a node only.
.TP
\fIIGNORE_JOBS\fR
Ignore currently running jobs when creating the reservation.
This can be especially useful when reserving all nodes in the system
for maintenance.
.TP
\fILICENSE_ONLY\fR
See \fIANY_NODES\fR.
.TP
\fIMAINT\fR
Maintenance mode, receives special accounting treatment.
This partition is permitted to use resources that are already in another
reservation.
.TP
\fIOVERLAP\fR
This reservation can be allocated resources that are already in another
reservation.
.TP
\fIPART_NODES\fR
This flag can be used to reserve all nodes within the specified
partition.  PartitionName and Nodes=ALL must be specified or
this option is ignored.
.TP
\fRPURGE_COMP\fR
Purge the reservation once the last associated job has completed.
Once the reservation has been created, it must be populated within 5 minutes
of its start time or it will be purged before any jobs have been run.
.TP
\fRREPLACE\fR
Resources allocated to jobs as automatically replenished using idle resources.
This option can be used to maintain a constant number of idle resources
available for pending jobs (subject to availability of idle resources).
This should be used with the \fINodeCnt\fP reservation option; do not identify
specific nodes to be included in the reservation.
This option is not supported on IBM Bluegene systems.
.TP
\fISPEC_NODES\fR
Reservation is for specific nodes (output only)
.TP
\fISTATIC_ALLOC\fR
Make it so after the nodes are selected for a reservation they don't
change.  Without this option when nodes are selected for a reservation
and one goes down the reservation will select a new node to fill the spot.
.TP
\fITIME_FLOAT\fR
The reservation start time is relative to the current time and moves forward
through time (e.g. a StartTime=now+10minutes will always be 10 minutes in the
future).
.TP
\fIWEEKLY\fR
Repeat the reservation at the same time every week
.RE

.TP
\fIFeatures\fP=<features>
Set the reservation's required node features. Multiple values
may be "&" separated if all features are required (AND operation) or
separated by "|" if any of the specified features are required (OR operation).
Value may be cleared with blank data value, "Features=".

.TP
\fIUsers\fP=<user list>
List of users permitted to use the reserved nodes, for example
"User=jones1,smith2".
A new reservation must specify Users and/or Accounts.
If both Users and Accounts are specified, a job must match both in order to
use the reservation.
Users can also be denied access to reservations by preceding all of the
user names with '\-'. Alternately precede the equal sign with '\-'.
For example, "User=-jones1,-smith2" or "User-=jones1,smith2"
will permit any user except jones1 and smith2 to use the reservation.
You can add or remove individual users from an existing reservation by
using the update command and adding a '+' or '\-' sign before the '=' sign.
If users are denied access to a reservation (user name preceded by a '\-'),
then all other users are implicitly allowed to use the reservation and it is
not possible to also explicitly specify allowed users.

.TP
\fITRES\fP=<tres_spec>
Comma\-separated list of TRES required for the reservation. Current supported
TRES types with reservations are: CPU, Node, License and BB. CPU and Node
follow the same format as CoreCnt and NodeCnt parameters respectively.
License names can be followed by an equal '=' and a count:

License/<name1>=<count1>[,License/<name2>=<count2>,...]

BurstBuffer can be specified in a similar way as BurstBuffer parameter. The
only difference is that colon symbol ':' should be replaced by an equal '='
in order to follow the TRES format.

Some examples of TRES valid specifications:

TRES=cpu=5,bb/cray=4,license/iop1=1,license/iop2=3

TRES=node=5k,license/iop1=2

As specified in CoreCnt, if a nodelist is specified, cpu can be an array
of core numbers by node:
nodes=compute[1\-3] TRES=cpu=2,2,1,bb/cray=4,license/iop1=2

Please note that CPU, Node, License and BB can override CoreCnt, NodeCnt,
Licenses and BurstBuffer parameters respectively.  Also CPU represents
CoreCnt, in a reservation and will be adjusted if you have threads per
core on your nodes.
