.SH "NAME"
slurmdbd \- Slurm Database Daemon.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBslurmdbd\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBslurmdbd\fR provides a secure enterprise\-wide interface to a database
for Slurm. This is particularly useful for archiving accounting records.
.TP
OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-D\fR
Debug mode. Execute \fBslurmdbd\fR in the foreground with logging to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Help; print a brief summary of command options.
.TP
\fB\-n <value>\fR

.TP
\fB\-v\fR

.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH "CORE FILE LOCATION"
If slurmdbd is started with the \fB\-D\fR option then the core file will be
written to the current working directory.
Otherwise if \fBLogFile\fR in "slurmdbd.conf" is a fully qualified
path name (starting with a slash), the core file will be written to
the same directory as the log file, provided SlurmUser has write
permission on the directory.  Otherwise the core file will be written
to "/var/tmp/" as a last resort.  If neither of the above directories
have write permission for SlurmUser, no core file will be produced.

.SH "NOTES"
It may be useful to experiment with different \fBslurmctld\fR specific
configuration parameters using a distinct configuration file
(e.g. timeouts).  However, this special configuration file will not be
used by the \fBslurmd\fR daemon or the Slurm programs, unless you
specifically tell each of them to use it. If you desire changing
communication ports, the location of the temporary file system, or
other parameters used by other Slurm components, change the common
configuration file, \fBslurm.conf\fR.
