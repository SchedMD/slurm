.SH "NAME"
slurmrestd \- Interface to Slurm via REST API.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBslurmrestd\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [(host:port)|(unix:/path/to/socket)]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBslurmrestd\fR is REST API interface for Slurm. It can be used in two modes:

.TP
Inetd Mode: slurmrestd will read and write to STDIN and STDOUT. It can detect if
it is connected to a socket or a locally TTY (interactive mode).

.TP
Listen Mode: slurmrestd will open a listening socket on each requested
host:port pair or UNIX socket.

.TP
.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB[host:port]\fR

Listen on local UNIX socket. Must have permission to create socket in
filesystem.
