1. Configuration file nrt.conf
1A. Add nrt.conf man page
1B. Add nrt.conf example
1C. Modify nrt.conf parsing and data structures to support adapter_type

2. NRT APIs
2A. Convert all Federation switch API calls to Torrent switch API calls
    (largely completed as part of evaluation, but largely untested)
2B. Convert Federation switch data structures to Torrent switch data structures
    Add adapter type
    In the adapter resources, how "spigot" used?
    "lid" and "network_id" are now arrays, how are they used?
    Resolve window state incompatabilities (data structure union, IB or HPCE)
    Remove adapter memory specifications (done)
    Many window and adapter fields that do remain have different sizes
    We have no details about the differences in data structures between IB and HPCE,
       but code changes for that will clearly be needed
    (started as part of evaluation, but the work is untested)

3. POE support
3A. Data structures needed to allocate resources to job are similar, but require some mods
    Minor changes needed to job credential
3B. Task launch completely new
    Pass window allocation information using socket
3C. Elimination of POE would require IBM to expose details of network communications
    Likely major effort and not possible without close cooperation with IBM
