 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * PMIX_Ring - execute ring exchange over processes in group
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 * + value    - input string
 * - maxvalue - max size of input and output strings
 *
 *  Output Parameters:
 *  + rank  - returns caller's rank within ring
 *  - ranks - returns number of procs within ring
 *  - left  - buffer to receive value provided by (rank - 1) % ranks
 *  - right - buffer to receive value provided by (rank + 1) % ranks
 *
 *  Return values:
 *  Returns 'MPI_SUCCESS' on success and an MPI error code on failure.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *  This function is collective, but not necessarily synchronous,
 *  across all processes in the process group to which the calling
 *  process belongs.  All processes in the group must call this
 *  function, but a process may return before all processes have called
 *  the function.
 *
 * int PMIX_Ring(const char value[], int *rank, int *ranks, char left[], char right[], int maxvalue);
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * For details on why this function is useful, see:
 *
 *   "PMI Extensions for Scalable MPI Startup",
 *   S. Chakrborty, H. Subramoni, J. Perkins, A. Moody,
 *   M. Arnold, and D. K. Panda, EuroMPI/ASIA 2014
 *
 * Here, PMIX_Ring is implemented as scan over the stepd tree.
 * Each application process sends a RING_IN message containing count,
 * left, and right values to its host stepd.  For this initial message,
 * count = 1 and left = right = input value provided by the app process.
 * After a stepd has received messages from all local tasks and all of
 * its stepd children (if any), it summarizes data received from all
 * procs and sends a RING_IN message up to its parent.
 *
 * When the root of the tree receives RING_IN messages from all
 * children, it computes and sends a custom RING_OUT message back to
 * each child.
 *
 * Upon receiving a RING_OUT message from its parent, a stepd computes
 * and sends a custom RING_OUT message to each of its children stepds
 * (if any) as well as responses to each application process.
 *
 * Each stepd process records the message received from each child
 * during the RING_IN phase, and it uses this data along with the
 * RING_OUT message from its parent to compute messages to send to its
 * children during the RING_OUT phase.
 *
 * With this algorithm, application processes on the same node are
 * assigned as consecutive ranks in the ring, and all processes within
 * a subtree are assigned as consecutive ranks within the ring.
 *
 * Going up the tree, the RING_IN message specifies the following:
 *   count - sum of app processes in subtree
 *   left  - left value from leftmost app process in subtree
 *   right - right value from rightmost app process in subtree
 *
 * Coming down the tree, the RING_OUT message species the following:
 *   count - rank to assign to leftmost app process in subtree
 *   left  - left value for leftmost app process in subtree
 *   right - right value for rightmost app process in subtree
