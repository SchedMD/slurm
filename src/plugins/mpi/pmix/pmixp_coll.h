 * This is important routine that takes responsibility to decide
 * what messages may appear and what may not. In absence of errors
 * we won't need this routine. Unfortunately they are exist.
 * There can be 3 general types of communication errors:
 * 1. We are trying to send our contribution to a parent and it fails.
 *    In this case we will be blocked in send function. At some point
 *    we either succeed or fail after predefined number of trials.
 *
 *    If we succeed - we are OK. Otherwise we will abort the whole job step.
 *
 * 2. A child of us sends us the message and gets the error, however we
 *    receive this message (false negative). Child will try again while we might be:
 *    (a) at FAN-IN step waiting for other contributions.
 *    (b) at FAN-OUT since we get all we need.
 *    (c) 2 step forward (SYNC) with coll->seq = (child_seq+1) if root of the tree
 *        successfuly broadcasted the whole database to us.
 *    (d) 3 step forward (next FAN-IN) with coll->seq = (child_seq+1)
 *        if somebody initiated next collective.
 *    (e) we won't move further because the child with problem won't send us
 *        next contribution.
 *
 *    Cases (a) and (b) can't be noticed here since child and we have the
 *    same seq number. They will later be detected  in pmixp_coll_contrib_node()
 *    based on collective contribution accounting vector.
 *
 *    Cases (c) and (d) would be visible here and should be treated as possible
 *    errors that should be ignored discarding the contribution.
 *
 *    Other cases are obvious error, we can abort in this case or ignore with
 *    error.
 *
 * 3. Root of the tree broadcasts the data and we get it, however root gets
 *    false negative. In this case root will try again. We might be:
 *    (a) at SYNC since we just got the DB and we are fine (coll->seq == root_seq+1)
 *    (b) at FAN-IN if somebody initiated next collective  (coll->seq == root_seq+1)
 *    (c) at FAN-OUT if we will collect all necessary contributions and send it to
 *        our parent.
 *    (d) we won't be able to switch to SYNC since root will be busy dealing with
 *        previous DB broadcast.
 *    (e) at FAN-OUT waiting for the fan-out msg while receiving next fan-in message
 *        from one of our children (coll->seq + 1 == child_seq).
