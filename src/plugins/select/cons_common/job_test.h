 * common_job_test - Given a specification of scheduling requirements,
 *	identify the nodes which "best" satisfy the request.
 * 	"best" is defined as either a minimal number of consecutive nodes
 *	or if sharing resources then sharing them with a job of similar size.
 * IN/OUT job_ptr - pointer to job being considered for initiation,
 *                  set's start_time when job expected to start
 * IN/OUT bitmap - usable nodes are set on input, nodes not required to
 *	satisfy the request are cleared, other left set
 * IN min_nodes - minimum count of nodes
 * IN req_nodes - requested (or desired) count of nodes
 * IN max_nodes - maximum count of nodes (0==don't care)
 * IN mode - SELECT_MODE_RUN_NOW   (0): try to schedule job now
 *           SELECT_MODE_TEST_ONLY (1): test if job can ever run
 *           SELECT_MODE_WILL_RUN  (2): determine when and where job can run
 * IN preemptee_candidates - List of pointers to jobs which can be preempted.
 * IN/OUT preemptee_job_list - Pointer to list of job pointers. These are the
 *		jobs to be preempted to initiate the pending job. Not set
 *		if mode=SELECT_MODE_TEST_ONLY or input pointer is NULL.
 * RET zero on success, EINVAL otherwise
 * globals (passed via select_p_node_init):
 *	node_record_count - count of nodes configured
 *	node_record_table_ptr - pointer to global node table
 * NOTE: the job information that is considered for scheduling includes:
 *	req_node_bitmap: bitmap of specific nodes required by the job
 *	contiguous: allocated nodes must be sequentially located
 *	num_cpus: minimum number of processors required by the job
 * NOTE: bitmap must be a superset of req_nodes at the time that
 *	select_p_job_test is called
