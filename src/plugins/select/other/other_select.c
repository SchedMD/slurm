/*****************************************************************************\
 *  other_select.c - node selection plugin wrapper for other select plugins.
 *
 *  NOTE: The node selection plugin itself is intimately tied to slurmctld
 *  functions and data structures. Some related functions (e.g. data structure
 *  un/packing, environment variable setting) are required by most Slurm
 *  commands. Since some of these commands must be executed on the BlueGene
 *  front-end nodes, the functions they require are here rather than within
 *  the plugin. This is because functions required by the plugin can not be
 *  resolved on the front-end nodes, so we can't load the plugins there.
