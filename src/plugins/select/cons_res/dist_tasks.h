/* dist_tasks_compute_c_b - compute the number of tasks on each
 * of the node for the cyclic and block distribution. We need to do
 * this in the case of consumable resources so that we have an exact
 * count for the needed hardware resources which will be used later to
 * update the different used resources per node structures.
 *
 * The most common case is when we have more resources than needed. In
 * that case we just "take" what we need and "release" the remaining
 * resources for other jobs. In the case where we oversubscribe the
 * CPUs/Logical processors resources we keep the initial set of
 * resources.
