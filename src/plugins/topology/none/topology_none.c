 * If the low-level plugin API is used, the contents of this string are
 * unimportant and may be anything.  SLURM uses the higher-level plugin
 * interface which requires this string to be of the form
 *
 *      <application>/<method>
 *
 * where <application> is a description of the intended application of
 * the plugin (e.g., "task" for task control) and <method> is a description
 * of how this plugin satisfies that application.  SLURM will only load
 * a task plugin if the plugin_type string has a prefix of "task/".
