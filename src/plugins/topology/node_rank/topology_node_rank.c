 * These variables are required by the generic plugin interface.  If they
 * are not found in the plugin, the plugin loader will ignore it.
 *
 * plugin_name - a string giving a human-readable description of the
 * plugin.  There is no maximum length, but the symbol must refer to
 * a valid string.
 *
 * plugin_type - a string suggesting the type of the plugin or its
 * applicability to a particular form of data or method of data handling.
 * If the low-level plugin API is used, the contents of this string are
 * unimportant and may be anything.  SLURM uses the higher-level plugin
 * interface which requires this string to be of the form
 *
 *      <application>/<method>
 *
 * where <application> is a description of the intended application of
 * the plugin (e.g., "task" for task control) and <method> is a description
 * of how this plugin satisfies that application.  SLURM will only load
 * a task plugin if the plugin_type string has a prefix of "task/".
 *
 * plugin_version - an unsigned 32-bit integer giving the version number
 * of the plugin.  If major and minor revisions are desired, the major
 * version number may be multiplied by a suitable magnitude constant such
 * as 100 or 1000.  Various SLURM versions will likely require a certain
 * minimum versions for their plugins as this API matures.
