 * plugin_type - a string suggesting the type of the plugin or its

 * If the low-level plugin API is used, the contents of this string are
 * unimportant and may be anything.  SLURM uses the higher-level plugin

 *
 *	<application>/<method>
 *
 * where <application> is a description of the intended application of
 * the plugin (e.g., "jobcomp" for SLURM job completion logging) and <method>
 * is a description of how this plugin satisfies that application.  SLURM will
 * only load job completion logging plugins if the plugin_type string has a
 * prefix of "jobcomp/".

 * plugin_version - an unsigned 32-bit integer containing the Slurm version
