 * These variables are required by the generic plugin interface.  If they

 * plugin_name - a string giving a human-readable description of the

 * a valid string.
 *
 * plugin_type - a string suggesting the type of the plugin or its
 * applicability to a particular form of data or method of data handling.
 * If the low-level plugin API is used, the contents of this string are
 * unimportant and may be anything.  SLURM uses the higher-level plugin
 * interface which requires this string to be of the form
 *
 *      <application>/<method>
 *
 * where <application> is a description of the intended application of
 * the plugin (e.g., "burst_buffer" for SLURM burst_buffer) and <method> is a
 * description of how this plugin satisfies that application.  SLURM will only
 * load a burst_buffer plugin if the plugin_type string has a prefix of
 * "burst_buffer/".
 *
 * plugin_version - an unsigned 32-bit integer containing the Slurm version
 * (major.minor.micro combined into a single number).
