 * plugin_type - a string suggesting the type of the plugin or its

 * If the low-level plugin API is used, the contents of this string are
 * unimportant and may be anything.  SLURM uses the higher-level plugin
 * interface which requires this string to be of the form
 *
 *	<application>/<method>
 *
 * where <application> is a description of the intended application of
 * the plugin (e.g., "auth" for SLURM authentication) and <method> is a
 * description of how this plugin satisfies that application.  SLURM will
 * only load authentication plugins if the plugin_type string has a prefix
 * of "auth/".
 *
 * plugin_version - an unsigned 32-bit integer containing the Slurm version
 * (major.minor.micro combined into a single number).
