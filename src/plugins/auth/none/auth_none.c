 *
 *	<application>/<method>
 *

 * the plugin (e.g., "auth" for SLURM authentication) and <method> is a
 * description of how this plugin satisfies that application.  SLURM will
 * only load authentication plugins if the plugin_type string has a prefix
 * of "auth/".

 * An opaque type representing authentication credentials.  This type can be
 * called whatever is meaningful and may contain any data required by the
 * plugin.  However, the plugin must be able to recover the Linux UID and
 * GID given only an object of this type.
 *
 * Since no verification of the credentials is performed in the "none"
 * authentication, this plugin simply uses the system-supplied UID and GID.
 * In a more robust authentication context, this might include tickets or
 * other signatures which the functions of this API can use to conduct
 * verification.
 *
 * The client code never sees the inside of this structure directly.
 * Objects of this type are passed in and out of the plugin via
 * anonymous pointers.  Because of this, robust plugins may wish to add
 * some form of runtime typing to ensure that the pointers they have
 * received are actually appropriate credentials and not pointers to
 * random memory.
 *
 * A word about thread safety.  The authentication plugin API specifies
 * that SLURM will exercise the plugin sanely.  That is, the authenticity
 * of a credential which has not been activated should not be tested.
 * However, the credential should be thread-safe.  This does not mean
 * necessarily that a plugin must recognize when an inconsistent sequence
 * of API calls is in progress, but if a plugin will crash or otherwise
 * misbehave if it is handed a credential in an inconsistent state (perhaps
 * it is in the process of being activated and a signature is incomplete)
 * then it is the plugin's responsibility to provide its own serialization\
 * to avoid that.
