 * Start a monitor pthread that will wait for a period of time,

 * variable UnkillableStepProgram.  (If UnkillableStepProgram is
 * not defined, the monitor thread and associated timer will not
 * be started.)
 *

 * step termination.  Then, if processes in the job step are unkillable,
 * an external program will be called that may be able to deal with
 * the situation.
 *
 * If step_terminate_monitor_stop() is called before the time runs
 * out, the external program will not be called.
