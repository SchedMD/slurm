	 * a^n - b^n = (a-b)*(a^(n-1) + b*a^(n-2) + b^2*a^(n-3) ... +b^(n-1))
	 * if we set a = 1, b = w (width) we will turn it to:
	 *
	 *        1 - w^n = (1-w)*(1 + w + w^2 + ... +w^(n-1))     (1)
	 *        C = (1 + w + w^2 + ... +w^(n-1))                 (2)
	 *
	 * is perfectly a number of children in the tree with width w.
	 * So we can calculate C from (1):
	 *
	 *        1 - w^n = (1-w)*C =>  C = (1-w^n)/(1-w)          (3)
	 *
	 * (2) takes (n-1) sums and (n-2) multiplication (or (n-2) exponentiations).
	 * (3) takes n+1 multiplications (or one exponentiation), 2 subtractions,
	 * 1 division.
	 * However if more optimal exponentiation algorithm is used like this
	 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring) number of
	 * multiplications will be O(log(n)).
	 * In case of (2) we will still need all the intermediate powers which
	 * doesn't allow to benefit from efficient exponentiation.
	 * As it is now - int_pow(x, n) is a primitive O(n) algorithm.
	 *
	 * w = 1 is a special case that will lead to divide by 0.
	 * as C (2) corresponds to a full number of nodes in the tree including
	 * the root - we need to return analog in the w=1 tree which is
	 * (depth+1).
