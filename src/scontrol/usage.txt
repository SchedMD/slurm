  <ENTITY> may be "aliases", "assoc_mgr", "bbstat", "burstBuffer",
       "config", "daemons", "dwstat", "federation", "frontend",
       "hostlist", "hostlistsorted", "hostnames", "job",
       "licenses", "node", "partition", "reservation", "slurmd",
       "step", or "topology"

  <ID> may be a configuration parameter name, job id, node name, partition
       name, reservation name, job step id, license name or hostlist or
       pathname to a list of host names.

  <HOSTLIST> may either be a comma separated list of host names or the
       absolute pathname of a file (with leading '/' containing host names
       either separated by commas or new-lines

  <LEVEL> may be an integer value like SlurmctldDebug in the slurm.conf
       file or the name of the most detailed errors to report (e.g. "info",
       "verbose", "debug", "debug2", etc.).

  <SLEVEL> may be an integer value like SlurmSchedLogLevel in the
       slurm.conf file or "enable" or "disable".

  <OPTS> may be "slurmctld" to shutdown just the slurmctld daemon,
       otherwise all slurm daemons are shutdown

  Node names may be specified using simple range expressions,
  (e.g. "lx[10-20]" corresponds to lx10, lx11, lx12, ...)
  The job step id is the job id followed by a period and the step id.
  Steps can be filtered by providing containerid=<id>.

  <SPECIFICATIONS> are specified in the same format as the configuration
  file. You may wish to use the "show" keyword then use its output as
  input for the update keyword, editing as needed.

  All commands and options are case-insensitive, although node names and
  partition names tests are case-sensitive (node names "LX" and "lx"
  are distinct).
