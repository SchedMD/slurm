/*
 * This slurm file parser provides a method for parsing a file
 * for key-value pairs of the form "key = value".  This parser can be used
 * for any slurm-like configuration file, not just slurm.conf.  If you are
 * looking for code specific to slurm.conf, look in
 * src/common/slurm_conf.[hc].
 *
 * In the parsed file, any amount of white-space is allowed between the
 * key, equal-sign, and value.  The parser handles comments, line
 * continuations, and escaped characters automatically.  Double-quotes can
 * be used to surround an entire value if white-space is needed within
 * a value string.
 *
 * A comment begins with a "#" and ends at the end of the line. A line
 * continuation is a "\" character at the end of the line (only white-space
 * may follow the "\").  A line continuation tells the parser to
 * concatenate the following line with the current line.
 *
 * To include a literal "\" or "#" character in a file, it can be escaped
 * by a preceding "\".
 *
 * Double-quotes CANNOT be escaped, and they must surround the entire value
 * string, they cannot be used within some substring of a value string.
 * An empty string can be specified with doubles quotes: Apple="".
 *
 * To use this parser, first construct an array of s_p_options_t structures.
 * Only the "key" string needs to be non-zero.  Zero or NULL are valid
 * defaults for type, handler, and destroy, which conventiently allows
 * then to be left out in any static initializations of options arrays. For
 * instance:
 *
 *	s_p_options_t options[] = {{"Apples", S_P_UINT16},
 *	                           {"Oranges"},
 *	                           {NULL}};
 *
 * In this example, the handler and destroy functions for the "Apples" key
 * are NULL pointers, and for key "Oranges" even the type is zero.  A zero
 * type is equivalent to specifying type S_P_IGNORE.
 *
 * Once an s_p_options_t array is defined, it is converted into a slurm
 * parser hash table structure with the s_p_hashtbl_create() function.
 * The s_p_hashtbl_t thus returned can be given to the s_p_parse_file()
 * function to parse a file, and fill in the s_p_hashtbl_t structure with
 * the values found in the file.  Values for keys can then be retrieved
 * from the s_p_hashtbl_t with the functions with names beginning with
 * "s_p_get_", e.g. s_p_get_boolean(), s_p_get_string(), s_p_get_uint16(),
 * etc.
 *
 * Valid types
 * -----------
 *
 * S_P_IGNORE - Any instance of specified key and associated value in a file
 *	will be allowed, but the value will not be stored and will not
 *	be retirevable from the s_p_hashtbl_t.
 * S_P_STRING - The value for a given key will be saved in string form, no
 *      converstions will be performed on the value.
 * S_P_LONG - The value for a given key must be a valid
 *	string representation of a long integer (as determined by strtol()),
 *	otherwise an error will be raised.
 * S_P_UINT16 - The value for a given key must be a valid
 *	string representation of an unsigned 16-bit integer.
 * S_P_LONG - The value for a given key must be be a valid
 *	string representation of an unsigned 32-bit integer.
 * S_P_POINTER - The parser makes no assumption about the type of the value.
 *    	The s_p_get_pointer() function will return a pointer to the
 *	s_p_hashtbl_t's internal copy of the value.  By default, the value
 *	will simply be the string representation of the value found in the file.
 *	This differs from S_P_STRING in that s_p_get_string() returns a COPY
 *	of the value which must be xfree'ed by the user.  The pointer
 *	returns by s_p_get_pointer() must NOT be freed by the user.
 *  	It is intended that normally S_P_POINTER with be used in conjunction
 *	with "handler" and "destroy" functions to implement a custom type.
 * S_P_ARRAY - This (and S_P_IGNORE, which does not record the fact that it
 *	has seen the key previously) is the only type which allows its key to
 * 	appear multiple times in a file.  With any other type (except
 *	S_P_IGNORE), an error will be raised when a key is seen more than
 *	once in a file.
 *	S_P_ARRAY works mostly the same as S_P_POINTER, except that it builds
 *	an array of pointers to the found values.
 *
 * Handlers and destructors
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Any key specified in an s_p_options_t array can have function callbacks for
 * a "handler" function and a "destroy" function.  The prototypes for each
 * are available below in the typedef of s_p_options_t.
 *
 * The "handler" function is given the "key" string, "value" string, and a
 * pointer to the remainder of the "line" on which the key-value pair was found
 * (this is the line after the parser has removed comments and concatenated
 * continued lines).  The handler can transform the value any way it desires,
 * and then return a pointer to the newly allocated value data in the "data"
 * pointer.  The handler shall also return int the "leftover" parameter a
 * pointer into the "line" buffer designating the start of any leftover,
 * unparsed characters in the string.  The return code from "handler" must be
 * -1 if the value is invalid, 0 if the value is valid but no value will be set
 * for "data" (the parser will not flag this key as already seen, and the
 * destroy() function will not be called during s_p_hashtbl_destroy()),
 * and 1 if "data" is set.
 *
 * If the "destroy" function is set for a key, and the parser will mark the key
 * as "seen" during parsing, then it will pass the pointer to the value data
 * to the "destroy" function when s_p_hashtbl_destroy() is called.  If
 * a key was "seen" during parsing, but the "destroy" function is NULL,
 * s_p_hashtbl_destroy() will call xfree() on the data pointer.
