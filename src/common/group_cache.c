/*
 * Theory of operation:
 * - Cache the extended groups for a (uid/username, gid).
 * - Cache expiration - the daemon needs to call group_cache_expire
 *   periodically to accomplish this, otherwise the cache will continue to
 *   grow.
 * - This always succeeds. The only error getgrouplist() is allowed to throw
 *   is -1 for not enough space, and we will xrealloc to handle this.
 *   In practice, if the name service cannot resolve a given user ID you will
 *   get an array back with a single element equal to the gid passed in.
