 * Description:
 *
 * void *xmalloc(size_t size);
 * void xrealloc(void *p, size_t newsize);
 * void xfree(void *p);
 * int  xsize(void *p);
 *
 * xmalloc(size) allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated
 * memory. The memory is set to zero. xmalloc() will not return unless
 * there are no errors. The memory must be freed using xfree().
 *
 * xrealloc(p, newsize) changes the size of the block pointed to by p to the
 * value of newsize. Newly allocated memory is zeroed. If p is NULL,
 * xrealloc() performs the same function as  `p = xmalloc(newsize)'. If p
 * is not NULL, it is required to have been initialized with a call to
 * [try_]xmalloc() or [try_]xrealloc().
 *
 * xfree(p) frees the memory block pointed to by p. The memory must have been
 * initialized with a call to [try_]xmalloc() or [try_]xrealloc().
 *
 * xsize(p) returns the current size of the memory allocation pointed to by
 * p. The memory must have been allocated with [try_]xmalloc() or
 * [try_]xrealloc().
