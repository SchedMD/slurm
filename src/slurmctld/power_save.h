 *  power_save.h - Support node power saving mode. Nodes which have been
 *  idle for an extended period of time will be placed into a power saving
 *  mode by running an arbitrary script. This script can lower the voltage
 *  or frequency of the nodes or can completely power the nodes off.
 *  When the node is restored to normal operation, another script will be
 *  executed. Many parameters are available to control this mode of operation.
