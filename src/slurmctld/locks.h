/*****************************************************************************\
 * Read/write locks are implemented by the routines in this directory by using
 * a set of three (3) UNIX semaphores to lock a resource.
 *
 * The set of three (3) semaphores represent a reader semaphore,
 * a writer semaphore and a writers waiting semaphore.
 *
 * The reader semaphore indicates the number of readers that currently have a
 * read lock on the resource.
 * The writers semaphore indicates that a writer has the resource locked.
 * The writers waiting semaphore indicates the number of writers waiting to
 * lock the resource.
 *
 * Readers cannot lock the resource until there are no writers waiting for the
 * resource and the resource is not locked by a writer.
 *
 * Writers cannot lock the resource if the resource is locked by other writers
 * or if any readers have the resource locked.
 *
 * Writers will have priority in locking the resource over readers because
 * of the writers waiting semaphore.  The writers waiting semaphore is incremented
 * by a writer that is waiting to lock the resource.  A reader cannot lock
 * the resource until there are no writers waiting to lock the resource and
 * the resource is not locked by a writer.
 *
 * So, if the resource is locked by an unspecified number of readers,
 * and a writer trys to lock the resource, then the writer will be blocked
 * until all of the previous readers have unlocked the resource.  But,
 * just before the writer checked to see if there were any readers locking
 * the resource, the writer incremented the writers waiting semaphore,
 * indicating that there is now a writer waiting to lock the resource.
 * In the mean time, if an unspecified number of readers try to lock the
 * resource after a writer (or writers) has tried to lock the resource,
 * those readers will be blocked until all writers have obtained the lock on
 * the resource, used the resource and unlocked the resource.  The subsequent
 * unspecified number of readers are blocked because they are waiting for the
 * number of writers waiting semaphore to become 0, meaning that there are no
 * writers waiting to lock the resource.
 *
 * use init_locks() to initialize the locks then
 * lock_slurmctld() and unlock_slurmctld() to get the ordering so as to
 * prevent deadlock. The arguments indicate the lock type required for
 * each entity (job, node, etc.) in a well defined order.
 * For example: no lock on the config data structure, read lock on the job
 * and node data structures, and write lock on the partition data structure
 * would look like this: "{ NO_LOCK, READ_LOCK, READ_LOCK, WRITE_LOCK }"
 *
 * NOTE: When using lock_slurmctld() and assoc_mgr_lock(), always call
 * lock_slurmctld() before calling assoc_mgr_lock() and then call
 * assoc_mgr_unlock() before calling unlock_slurmctld().
