Slurm Workload Manager
--------------------------------------------------------

This is the Slurm Workload Manager. Slurm
is an open-source cluster resource management and job scheduling system
that strives to be simple, scalable, portable, fault-tolerant, and
interconnect agnostic. Slurm currently has been tested only under Linux.

As a cluster resource manager, Slurm provides three key functions. First,
it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources
(compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform
work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and
monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated
nodes. Finally, it arbitrates conflicting requests for resources by
managing a queue of pending work.

SOURCE DISTRIBUTION HIERARCHY
-----------------------------

The top-level distribution directory contains this README as well as
other high-level documentation files, and the scripts used to configure
and build Slurm (see INSTALL). Subdirectories contain the source-code
for Slurm as well as a DejaGNU test suite and further documentation. A
quick description of the subdirectories of the Slurm distribution follows:

  src/        [ Slurm source ]
     Slurm source code is further organized into self explanatory
     subdirectories such as src/api, src/slurmctld, etc.

  doc/        [ Slurm documentation ]
     The documentation directory contains some latex, html, and ascii
     text papers, READMEs, and guides. Manual pages for the Slurm
     commands and configuration files are also under the doc/ directory.

  etc/        [ Slurm configuration ]
     The etc/ directory contains a sample config file, as well as
     some scripts useful for running Slurm.

  slurm/      [ Slurm include files ]
     This directory contains installed include files, such as slurm.h
     and slurm_errno.h, needed for compiling against the Slurm API.

  testsuite/  [ Slurm test suite ]
     The testsuite directory contains the framework for a set of
     DejaGNU and "make check" type tests for Slurm components.
     There is also an extensive collection of Expect scripts.

  auxdir/     [ autotools directory ]
     Directory for autotools scripts and files used to configure and
     build Slurm

  contribs/   [ helpful tools outside of Slurm proper ]
     Directory for anything that is outside of slurm proper such as a
     different api or such.  To have this build you need to do a
     make contrib/install-contrib.
