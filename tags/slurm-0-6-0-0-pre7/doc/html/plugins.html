<td valign="top"><h2><a name="top">SLURM Plugin API</a></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A SLURM plugin is a dynamically linked code object which is loaded explicitly 
at run time by the SLURM libraries. A plugin provides a customized implementation 
of a well-defined API connected to tasks such as authentication, interconnect 
fabric, and task scheduling.</p>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<p>A SLURM plugin identifies itself by a short character string formatted similarly 
to a MIME type: <i>&lt;major&gt;/&lt;minor&gt;</i>. The major type identifies 
which API the plugin implements. The minor type uniquely distinguishes a plugin 
from other plugins that implement that same API, by such means as the intended 
platform or the internal algorithm. For example, a plugin to interface to the 
Maui scheduler would give its type as &quot;sched/maui.&quot; It would implement 
the SLURM Scheduler API.</p>
<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>SLURM plugin version numbers comprise a major and minor revision number. As 
SLURM evolves, changes to the individual plugin APIs may be necessary to implement 
new features. The major number identifies the version of the applicable API that 
the plugin implements. Incrementing the major version number denotes that the 
API has changed significantly and possibly incompatibly over prior versions.</p>
<p>Because plugins are separate code objects and perhaps under the control of 
third parties, version skew may occur in a SLURM installation. SLURM may support 
multiple versions of each API in a backward-compatible fashion to provide time 
for plugin authors to update their plugins. Conversely, the plugin may support 
multiple versions of the API in order to be transparently portable across different 
SLURM installations. The version of the API spoken in an installation will be 
the highest-numbered version which is common to both SLURM and the plugin. Each 
SLURM release will document which API versions it supports. From time to time 
ancient API versions will be deprecated.</p>
<p>The minor version number is incremented at the discretion of the plugin author 
and denotes revisions or upgrades particular to that implementation. If two or 
more plugins of the same type are provided in an installation, the plugin with 
the highest minor revision will be selected.</p>

<h3>Data Objects</h3>
<p>A plugin must define and export the following symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="commandline">char plugin_type[]<br>
</span> a unique, short, formatted string to identify the plugin's purpose as 
described above. A &quot;null&quot; plugin (i.e., one that implements the desired 
API as stubs) should have a minor type of &quot;none.&quot;</li>
<li><span class="commandline">char plugin_name[]<br>
</span> a free-form string that identifies the plugin in human-readable terms, 
such as &quot;Kerberos authentication.&quot; SLURM will use this string to identify 
the plugin to end users.</li>
<li><span class="commandline">const uint32_t plugin_version</span><br>
a 32-bit unsigned integer giving the version of the plugin as described above. 
The major revision number is multiplied by 1,000 and added to the minor revision 
number to produce the integer value. Thus, a plugin with a major revision number 
of 2 and a minor revision number of 35 will have a <span class="commandline">plugin_version</span> 
value of 2035.</li>
</ul>
<p>A plugin may optionally define and export the following symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>const uint32_t plugin_legacy<br>
a 32-bit unsigned integer formatted the same as <span class="commandline">plugin_version</span> 
giving the lowest API version number with which this plugin is compatible. If 
this symbol is omitted, its value is assumed to be equivalent to the <span class="commandline">plugin_version</span> 
rounded to the next lowest 1,000. Only the major version number of this symbol 
is significant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>API Functions</h3>
<p class="commandline">int init (void);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: If present, this function is called 
just after the plugin is loaded. This allows the plugin to perform any global 
initialization prior to any actual API calls.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>: None.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: SLURM_SUCCESS if the plugin's initialization 
was successful. Any other return value indicates to SLURM that the plugin should 
be unloaded and not used.</p>
<p class="commandline">void fini (void);</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Description</b>: If present, this function is called 
just before the plugin is unloaded. This allows the plugin to do any finalization 
after the last plugin-specific API call is made.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Arguments</b>: None.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.2in"><b>Returns</b>: None.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: These functions are not the same as those described in the <span class="commandline">dlopen 
(3)</span> system library. The C run-time system co-opts those symbols for its 
own initialization. The system <span class="commandline">init()</span> is called 
before the SLURM <span class="commandline">plugininit()</span>, and the SLURM 
<span class="commandline">fini()</span> is called before the system's <span class="commandline">fini()</span>.</p>
<p>The functions need not appear. The plugin may provide either <span class="commandline">init()</span> 
or <span class="commandline">fini()</span> or both.</p>
<p class="footer"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3>Thread Safety</h3>
<p>SLURM is a multithreaded application. The SLURM plugin library may exercise 
the plugin functions in a re-entrant fashion. It is the responsibility of the 
plugin author to provide the necessarily mutual exclusion and synchronization 
in order to avoid the pitfalls of re-entrant code.</p>
<h3>Run-time Support</h3>
<p>The standard system libraries are available to the plugin. The SLURM libraries 
are also available and plugin authors are encouraged to make use of them rather 
than develop their own substitutes. Plugins should use the SLURM log to print 
error messages.</p>
<p>The plugin author is responsible for specifying any specific non-standard libraries 
needed for correct operation. Plugins will not load if their dependent libraries 
are not available, so it is the installer's job to make sure the specified libraries 
are available.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All plugin functions are expected to execute very quickly. If any function 
entails delays (e.g. transations with other systems), it should be written to 
utilize a thread for that functionality. This thread may be created by the 
<span class="commandline">init()</span> function and deleted by the 
<span class="commandline">fini()</span> functions. See <b>plugins/sched/backfill</b>
for an example of how to do this.</p>
