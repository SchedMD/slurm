.TH SACCT "1" "April 2009" "sacct 2.0" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
sacct \- displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the
SLURM job accounting log or SLURM database

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacct\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with SLURM are either logged
in the job accounting log file or saved to the SLURM database.
.PP
The
.BR "sacct "
command displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log
file or SLURM database in a variety of forms for your analysis.
The
.BR "sacct "
command displays information on jobs, job steps, status, and exitcodes by
default.
You can tailor the output with the use of the
\f3\-\-fields=\fP
option to specify the fields to be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the
.BR "sacct "
command displays job accounting data for all users, although there are
options to filter the output to report only the jobs from a specified
user or group.
.PP
For the non\-root user, the
.BR "sacct "
command limits the display of job accounting data to jobs that were
launched with their own user identifier (UID) by default.
Data for other users can be displayed with the
\f3\-\-all\fP,
\f3\-\-user\fP,
or
\f3\-\-uid\fP
options.
.TP "10"
\f3Note: \fP\c
Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your systems
\f2getrusage(3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.
.IP
If \-\-dump is specified, the field selection options (\-\-brief,
\-\-format, ...) have no effect.
.IP
Elapsed time fields are presented as 2 fields, integral seconds and integral microseconds
.IP
If \-\-dump is not specified, elapsed time fields are presented as
[[days-]hours:]minutes:seconds.hundredths.
.IP
The default input file is the file named in the jobacct_logfile
parameter in slurm.conf.

The section titled "INTERPRETING THE \-\-dump OPTION OUTPUT" describes the
data output when this option is used.

.TP
\f3\-\-duplicates\fP
If SLURM job ids are reset, but the job accounting log file isn't
reset at the same time (with \-e, for example), some job numbers will
probably appear more than once in the accounting log file to refer to
different jobs; such jobs can be distinguished by the "submit" time
stamp in the data records.
.IP
When data for specific jobs are requested with the \-\-jobs option, we
assume that the user wants to see only the most recent job with that
number. This behavior can be overridden by specifying \-\-duplicates, in
which case all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.

.TP
\f3suspended\fP
How long the job was suspended for.

.TP
\f3systemcpu\fP
The amount of system CPU time. (If job was running on multiple cpus this

\f3timelimit\fP
What the timelimit was/is for the job.
