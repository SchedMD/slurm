.TH SLURMCTLD "8" "June 2006" "slurmctld 12.0" "Slurm components"
.SH "NAME"
slurmctld \- The central management daemon of Slurm.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBslurmctld\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBslurmctld\fR is the central management daemon of Slurm. It monitors
all other Slurm daemons and resources, accepts work (jobs), and allocates
resources to those jobs. Given the critical functionality of \fBslurmctld\fR,
there may be a backup server to assume these functions in the event that
the primary server fails.
.TP
OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Clear all previous \fBslurmctld\fR state from its last checkpoint.
Without this option, previously running jobs will be preserved along
with node \fIState\fR of DOWN, DRAINED and DRAINING nodes and the associated
\fIReason\fR field for those nodes.

.TP
\fB\-D\fR
Debug mode. Execute \fBslurmctld\fR in the foreground with logging to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-f <file>\fR
Read configuration from the specified file. See \fBNOTES\fR below.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Help; print a brief summary of command options.
.TP
\fB\-L <file>\fR
Write log messages to the specified file.

.TP
\fB\-R\fR
Recover full state from last checkpoint: jobs, node, and partition state. 
Without this option, previously running jobs will be preserved along
with node \fIState\fR of DOWN, DRAINED and DRAINING nodes and the associated
\fIReason\fR field for those nodes. No other node or partition state will 
be preserved.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose operation. Multiple \fB\-v\fR's increase verbosity.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables can be used to override settings
compiled into slurmctld.
.TP 20
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the SLURM configuration file. This is overridden by
explicitly naming a configuration file on the command line.

.SH "NOTES"
It may be useful to experiment with different \fBslurmctld\fR specific
configuration parameters using a distinct configuration file
(e.g. timeouts).  However, this special configuration file will not be
used by the \fBslurmd\fR daemon or the Slurm programs, unless you
specifically tell each of them to use it. If you desire changing
communication ports, the location of the temporary file system, or
other parameters used by other Slurm components, change the common
configuration file, \fBslurm.conf\fR.
