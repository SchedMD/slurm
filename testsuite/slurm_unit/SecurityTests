LLNL Security Tests
1 December 2008

Unless otherwise noted. Run all tests as a normal user (not user root or
SlurmUser).

For computers running the slurmdbd daemon, run tests 1.x and 4.x only.
For computers running the slurmctld or slurmd daemon, run tests 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x only.



Test 1.1     Verify file permissions
====================================
Execute "slurmctld/security_1_1.py" and check for errors. If the installation
directory is not "/usr" and the configuration directory not "/etc/slurm" then
specify the appropriate locations using the "--prefix" and "--sysconfdir" 
options. It's last line will be "SUCCESS" if there were no errors and 
"FAILURE" otherwise. File which do not exist or their directories can not
be read are noted as "WARNING:". Some warnings are expected unless a complete
SLURM installation (all RPMs) is performed and the test is executed as user
root. The output near the top with a prefix of "NOTE:" describes these cases.
Example:
$ ./slurmctld/security_1_1.py --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/slurm
NOTE: slurm_epilog and slurm_prolog only exist on BlueGene systems
NOTE: federation.conf only exists on AIX systems
NOTE: sview, slurmdbd and slurmdbd.conf exists only on selected systems
NOTE: JobCredentialPrivateKey, SlurmctldLogFile, and StateSaveLocation only on control host
NOTE: SlurmdLogFile and SlurmdSpoolDir only exist on compute servers
Ensuring the following are not world writable:
OK: 755 /etc/slurm
OK: 444 /etc/slurm/slurm.conf
WARNING: Unable to stat /etc/slurm/bluegene.conf
...
OK: 755 /usr/lib/slurm/proctrack_sgi_job.so
OK: 755 /usr/lib/slurm/checkpoint_ompi.so
Ensuring the following are not world readable:
WARNING: Unable to stat /etc/slurm/slurm.private.key  < only on control hosts
WARNING: Unable to stat /etc/slurm/slurmdbd.conf      < only on slurmdbd host
WARNING: Unable to stat /etc/slurm/wiki.conf          < only on control host
SUCCESS


Test 1.2     Verify that SlurmUser is unique
============================================
Execute "slurmctld/security_1_2.bash" and check for errors. Make sure that the
"scontrol" program is in your default search path or modify the script. It's 
last line of output will be "SUCCESS" if there were no errors and "FAILURE" 
otherwise. 
Example for systems running slurmctld:
$ ./slurmctld/security_1_2.bash
slurm:x:97:97:Slurm user:/var/slurm:/bin/false
SUCCESS

Example for systems running only slurmdbd:
$ grep slurm /etc/passwd
slurm:x:101:101:slurm:/var/slurm:/sbin/nologin
$ grep ":101:" /etc/passwd
slurm:x:101:101:slurm:/var/slurm:/sbin/nologin   < Note no other users/groups with ID of 101


Test 2.1     Verify that unauthenticated requests are rejected
==============================================================
Execute "slurmctld/security_2_1.bash" and check for errors. Make sure that the
"scontrol" program is in your default search path or modify the script. It's 
last line of output will be "SUCCESS" if there were no errors and "FAILURE" 
otherwise. Note that srun errors are expected due to authentication failure.
NOTE: Insure the event is logged in SlurmctldLogFile for test 2.4 verification.
Example:
$ ./slurmctld/security_2_1.bash
srun: warning: auth/dummy plugin selected
srun: warning: auth/dummy plugin selected
srun: warning: auth/dummy plugin selected
srun: error: slurm_receive_msg: Zero Bytes were transmitted or received
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Zero Bytes were transmitted or received
srun errors above are expected
SUCCESS


Test 2.2.1   Verify that normal user can't reconfigure the system
=================================================================
Execute "scontrol reconfig".
NOTE: Insure the event is logged in SlurmctldLogFile for test 2.4 verification.
Example:
$ scontrol reconfig
slurm_reconfigure error: Invalid user id


Test 2.2.2   Verify that jobs can't be run as another user
==========================================================
First run a job as ourself and they try to do so as another user. On some
systems the pdebug partition should be specified. On BlueGene systems a 
batch script must be submitted (use "sbatch --partition=pdebug security_2_2_2.sh")
NOTE: Insure the event is logged in SlurmctldLogFile for test 2.4 verification.

Linux/AIX example:
$ srun --partition=pdebug id
uid=5136(jette) gid=5136(jette) groups=902(pcs),1153(bgldev),1310(aixdev),5136(jette)
$ srun --partition=pdebug --uid=0 id
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid user id

BlueGene example:
$ sbatch --partition=pdebug security_2_2_2.sh
sbatch: Submitted batch job 1784597
$ sbatch --partition=pdebug --uid=0 security_2_2_2.sh
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid user id


Test 2.2.3   Verify that one user can't modify another user's job
=================================================================
Submit a job as one user then try to cancel or modify it as another user:
$ sbatch --partition=pdebug security_2_2_2.sh
sbatch: Submitted batch job 1784601
FROM A DIFFERENT USER (NOT root or SlurmUser):
$ scancel 1784601
scancel: error: Kill job error on job id 1784601: Access denied
$ scontrol update jobid=1784601 timelimit=4
slurm_update error: Invalid user id


Test 2.2.4   Verify SLURM's wiki interface is secure
====================================================
SLURM's wiki interface is used by Moab to start and modify user jobs and is 
protected by a digital signature. This test confirms that attempts to use the 
wiki interface without the proper signature will fail. First we need to build
the test then execute it. The build lines vary by architecture.
NOTE: Insure the event is logged in SlurmctldLogFile for test 2.4 verification.
For BlueGene:
$ gcc -m64 -L/usr/lib64 -lslurm -osecurity_2_2_4 security_2_2_4.c
For peleton:
$ cc -L/usr/lib64 -lslurm -osecurity_2_2_4 security_2_2_4.c
For other Linux systems:
$ cc -lslurm -osecurity_2_2_4 security_2_2_4.c
Then execute thus:
$ ./security_2_2_4
Bad checksum reported
SUCCESS

For AIX only (I am having linking problems. This work-around will work):
$ export OBJECT_MODE=32
$ AIX=1 gcc -I/opt/freeware/include -L/opt/freeware/lib -lslurm -osecurity_2_2_4 -pthread security_2_2_4.c
$ scontrol show config | grep ControlAddr  (substitute the value in execution below)
Then execute thus:
$ ./security_2_2_4 <ControlAddr>
Bad checksum reported
SUCCESS


Test 2.3     Verify that trigger program runs a the proper user
===============================================================
Since SlurmUser is not root at LLNL, this is a no-op for now. Test by 
executing "slurmctld/security_2_3.sh".
$ slurmctld/security_2_3.sh
Executing:
strigger --set --idle --offset=0 --program=/g/g0/jette/slurm-1.3.way/testsuite/slurm_unit/slurmctld/security_2_3_in
slurm_set_trigger: Operation not permitted
If this failure is a security violation, that's fine

[Dec 01 12:24:55] error: wiki: message checksum error


Test 3.1     Verify slurm only accepts requests with valid credential
=====================================================================
Submit a job with a fabricated credential (lacking a proper digital 
signature). 
NOTE: Insure the event is logged in SlurmdLogFile for test 3.3 verification.
Example:
$ srun -Z -w adev7 hostname
srun: do not allocate resources
srun: error: Task launch failed on node adev7(0): Invalid job credential
srun: error: 1 launch request failed
srun: Job Failed


Test 3.2     Verify slurm only accepts attach requests from valid user
======================================================================
Start a job as one user, then attept attaching to it from a different user.
NOTE: This test is not applicable for BlueGene systems.
NOTE: Insure the event is logged in SlurmdLogFile for test 3.3 verification.
Example:
$ srun -w adev7 slurmd/security_3_2.csh
Mon Dec  1 15:03:56 PST 2008
Mon Dec  1 15:04:06 PST 2008
Mon Dec  1 15:04:16 PST 2008
From a different window for the same user:
[jette@adevi etc]$ sattach 97700.0
Mon Dec  1 15:03:56 PST 2008
Mon Dec  1 15:04:06 PST 2008
Mon Dec  1 15:04:16 PST 2008
From a different window as a different user:
$ sattach 97700.0
sattach: error: Could not get job step info: Access denied


Test 3.3     Verify security violations are logged
==================================================
From test 3.1 in SlurmdLogFile on node where job tried to run:
[Dec 01 14:58:00] error: Invalid job credential from 5136@192.168.17.198: Invalid job credential

From test 3.3 in SlurmctldLogFile:
[Dec 01 15:15:50] error: Security violation, REQUEST_STEP_LAYOUT for JobId=97700 from uid=7558


Test 4.1     Verify that valid credential is required for SlurmDBD access
=========================================================================
TBD


Test 4.2     Verify that that only authorized users can access the SlurmDBD database
====================================================================================
Try to add a dummy cluster name as a non-priviledged user the computers master node.
NOTE: THIS IS NOT LOGGED ANYWHERE. THAT IS A PROBLEM.
Example:
$ sacctmgr add cluster foo_bar
 Adding Cluster(s)
  Name          = foo_bar
sacctmgr: error: slurmdbd(2002): from 1405: Your user doesn't have privilege to preform this action
 Problem adding clusters
sacctmgr: slurmdbd: reopening connection


Test 4.3     Verify SlurmDBD security violations are logged
===========================================================
From test 4.2 in WHAT FILE:
TBD
