# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Validate scontrol change gres count with File is disabled.
#          If a GRES is associated with a File then we should not be able to
#          change it's count to anything other than zero as there is no
#          mechanism to identify the specific GRES to remove (i.e. say we
#          want to remove /dev/nvidia2 on a node with /dev/nvidia[0-3]).
#          We use gres/gpu for this test since those need to be associated
#          with specific device files.
