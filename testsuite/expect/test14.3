# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Confirm that sbcast reports a proper version number (--version
#          option).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
