# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Confirm that srun sets appropriate working directory (--chdir option).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
#
# NOTE:    Due to symbolic links, we only look to match the last component
#          of the directory name (e.g "cd /tmp; pwd" might return "/var/tmp").
