# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test of sched/wiki plugin. This is intended to execute in the
#          place of Maui and emulate its actions to confirm proper
#          operation of the plugin.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
