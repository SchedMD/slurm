# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Validate scontrol show commands for configuration, daemons,
#          nodes, frontends, and partitions.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
