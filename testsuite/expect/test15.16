# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Verify that Slurm directed environment variables are processed:
#          SALLOC_BELL and SALLOC_NO_BELL (can't really confirm from Expect)
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
