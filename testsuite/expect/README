This directory contains a battery of Slurm regression tests. The tests make
use of the "expect" scripting language. You can create "globals.local" and
identify locations of files to be used in testing, especially the variable
"slurm_dir". These tests expect single node jobs submitted to the default
partition to respond within a 120 seconds.  If that is not the case, modify
the value of "max_job_delay" in the "globals.local" file to an appropriate
value or the tests will report failures due to timeouts.  If there are file
propagation delays (e.g. due to NFS), the value of "max_file_delay" in the
"globals.local" file may need modification. For example:
    $ cat globals.local
    set slurm_dir     "/usr/local"
    set max_job_delay 300

Each test can be executed independently. Upon successful completion, the test
will print "SUCCESS" and terminate with an exit code of zero. Upon failure,
the test will typically print "FAILURE" and an explanation of the failure.
The message "WARNING" indicates that the cluster configuration can not fully
test some option (e.g. only one node or partition) and the test terminates
with an exit code of zero. In the event of a configuration problem or other
catastrophic test failure other messages could be printed and their cause
should be investigated. In either case, failing tests will terminate with a
non-zero exit code and successful tests will terminate with a zero exit code.

The test is designed to be executed from a cluster-wide file system.
File created on one node in the cluster should be visible to all other
nodes in the cluster. If not executed in such an environment, many tests
will fail.

The script "regression" will execute all of the tests and summarize the
results. Standard output contains detailed logging of all events, which is
quite verbose. Failure information is written to standard error. A good
way to run "regression" is to write its standard output to one file and
either write standard error to another file or print it to the terminal.
Execution time of the full test suite is roughly 80 minutes, but can vary
considerably with the architecture, configuration, and system load. Some
tests send e-mail, so check for four e-mail messages sent to the user
running the tests. Here is an example.
    $ ./regression >slurm.test.tux.Aug3
    Completions:357
    Failures:   0
    Time (sec): 4375
    Remember to check for mail send by tests

When failures do occur, check the standard output for details. Searching
for the keyword "FAILURE" will typically locate the failing test. Note
that some of the tests are architecture or configuration specific.  Also
note that most tests are designed to be run as a normal user. Tests 3.#
are designed to be run as user root or SlurmUser, but will be skipped
when the full test suite is executed as an unprivileged user. The full
test suite is typically executed many times by the Slurm developers on a
variety of systems before a Slurm release is made. This has resulted in
high system reliability. When Slurm bugs are found or features added,
this test suite is expanded.

A summary of each test is shown below.
