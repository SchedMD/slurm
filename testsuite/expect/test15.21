# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Test of contiguous option with multiple nodes (--contiguous option).
#
# NOTE:    This assumes node names are of the form <alpha><number>, where
#          the value of <number> indicates the nodes relative location.
#          Change tha node name parsing logic as needed for other formats.
