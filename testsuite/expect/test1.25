# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Submit job to not be killed on node failure (--no-kill option).
#          NOTE: We need to actually kill slurmd daemons to fully test this.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "WARNING: ..." with an explanation of why the test can't be made, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
