# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test of processors, memory, and temporary disk space
#          constraints options (--mincpus, --mem, and --tmp options).
#          Also test that priority zero job is not started (--hold
#          option).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
