# Purpose:  Test of slurm_job_step_stat() and slurm_load_job() API calls.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
#
# Note:    This script generates and then deletes a file in the working
#          directory named test7.12.prog
