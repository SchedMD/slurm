# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test of batch job and job name options (--batch and --job-name 
#          options).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
#
# Note:    This script generates and then deletes files in the working directory 
#          named test1.11.input, test1.11.output, and test1.11.error
