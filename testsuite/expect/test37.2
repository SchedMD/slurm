# Purpose: Test federation functionality
#          Test that submissions to clusters in federation get unique job id.
#
# Reqs:    1. Using slurmdbd accounting storage type and is up
#          2. fed_slurm_base is defined in globals.local - set to directory that
#          has access to each federation configure (fedc1, fedc2, fedc3).
#          Eg.
#          fedr/slurm/ (src)
#          fedr/fed1/bin
#          fedr/fed1/sbin
#          fedr/fed1/etc
#          fedr/fed1/...
#          fedr/fed2/...
#          fedr/fed3/...
#          3. controllers are up and running.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
