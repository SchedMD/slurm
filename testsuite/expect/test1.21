# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test srun stdin/out routing with specific task number (--input
#          and --output options with numeric argument).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
