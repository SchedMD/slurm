# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Test that a job executes with the specified nodes, requires multiple
#          nodes (--nodes, --nodelist and --exclude options).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "WARNING: ..." with an explanation of why the test can't be made, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
