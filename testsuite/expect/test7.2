# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Test of PMI functions available via API library. Tests
#          --pmi-threads option in srun command.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
