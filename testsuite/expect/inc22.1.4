# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Test for jobs that ran on a node at a certain time from
#          configuration set up in test22.1.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
