# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Test of user signal upon allocation (--bell and --no-bell options).
#          We can't really confirm these are processed, but just make sure
#          that salloc does not choke on the options
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
