# Purpose: Test of Slurm functionality
#          Test scancel signal to batch script (--batch option)
#
# Note:    This script generates and then deletes files in the working directory
#          named test6.12.input, test6.12.output, and test6.12.error

# be killed by the SIGINT, then the batch script would exit triggering
