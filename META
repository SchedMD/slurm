  Version:	13.12.0
  Release:	0pre4

##
#  When changing API_CURRENT update src/common/slurm_protocol_common.h
#  with a new SLURM_PROTOCOL_VERSION signifing the old one and the version
#  it was so the slurmdbd can continue to send the old protocol version.
#  In src/common/slurm_protocol_util.c check_header_version(),
#  and _get_slurm_version()
#  need to be updated also when changes are added also.
#
#  NOTE: The API version can not be the same as the Slurm version above.  The
#        version in the code is referenced as a uint16_t which if 1312 was the
#        API_CURRENT it would go over the limit.  So keep is a relatively
#        small number.
