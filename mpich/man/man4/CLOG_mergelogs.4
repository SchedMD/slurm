On process 0 in MPI_COMM_WORLD, collect logs from other processes and merge
them with own log.  Timestamps are assumed to be already adjusted on both
incoming logs and the master's.  On the other processes, fill in length and
process id's and send them, a block at a time, to the master.  The master
writes out the merged log.
