# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Confirm that a job executes with the proper task distribution
#          (--nodes and --distribution options).
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "WARNING: ..." with an explanation of why the test can't be made, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
