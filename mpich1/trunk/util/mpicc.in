# Script to compile and link MPI programs
# We'd like to just add a few libraries to the link line and an include
# directory to the compile line, but some systems that MPICH supports make
# that difficult because the compiler and the linker are different programs.
# Thus, this code tries to figure out which options go where, at least for
# things that are different between compile and link steps.
#
# New Organization:
# To better support a range of compilers and library formats, the compilation
# scripts can now read a configuration file describing the compiler (defaults
# are provided in the script for the default case, i.e., same as MPICH was 
# built with.  This file is mpicc-<compilername>.conf.  For example, a
# typical installation might have mpicc-cc.conf and mpicc-gcc.conf, for the 
# vendor compiler and gcc, respectively.  These are selected by either setting
# the environment variable CC, or using the -config name switch.
