Completed build of MPI.  Check the output for errors Also try executing 'make
testing' in examples/test (This relies on mpirun, which currently works for
many but not all systems.  For workstation networks, mpirun requires that you
first setup a "machines" file listing the machines available; this is covered
in the installation manual.)
 
Send bugs and comments to mpi-bugs@mcs.anl.gov
Bugs and comments in the C++ support should be sent to mpi2cpp-devel@osl.iu.edu
Bugs and comments in the MPI-IO support should be sent to 
romio-maint@mcs.anl.gov

With any bug report, please send
        The version of MPICH (e.g., 1.2.7)
 
The output of running your program with the -mpiversion argument
(e.g., mpirun -np 1 a.out -mpiversion)
 
The output of 
        uname -a
for your system.  If you are on an SGI system, also
        hinv
 
If the problem is with a script like configure or mpirun, run the script with
the -echo argument (e.g., mpirun -echo -np 4 a.out )
 
If you are using a network of workstations, also send the output of
bin/tstmachines.
