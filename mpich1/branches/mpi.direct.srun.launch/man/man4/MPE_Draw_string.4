.SH NOTES FOR FORTRAN INTERFACE 
The Fortran interface to this routine is different from its C
counterpart and it has an additional argument, ierr, at the end
of the argument list, i.e. the returned function value (the error
code) in C interface is returned as the additional argument in
Fortran interface.  The Fortran interface is invoked with the
CALL statement.

All MPI and MPE objects, MPI_Comm, MPE_XGraph and MPE_Color, are
of type INTEGER in Fortran.

.SH ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR FORTRAN INTERFACE 
The trailing blanks in Fortran CHARACTER string argument will be
ignored.
