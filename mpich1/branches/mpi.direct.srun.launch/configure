Packages that may be included with MPICH

--with-device=name     - Use the named device for communication.  Known
                         names include ch_p4, ch_mpl, ch_shmem, and globus2.
                         If not specified, a default is chosen.  Special 
                         options for the device are specified after the 
                         device name, separated by a colon.  E.g., 
                         --with-device=globus2:-flavor=mpi,nothreads
--with-romio[=OPTIONS] - Use ROMIO to provide MPI-I/O from MPI-2 (default).
                         The options include --with-file-system=FSTYPE, where
                         fstype can be any combination of nfs, ufs, 
                         pfs (intel), piofs (IBM), hfs (HP), sfs (NEC), and 
                         xfs (SGI), combined with '+'.  If romio is not
                         included, the Fortran 90 modules cannot be built.
--with-mpe             - Build the MPE environment (default)
--with-coll[=name]     - Select the implementation of the MPI collective
                         routines that should be used.  By default, uses
                         the most advanced version.  The name is the name of
                         the file (without the suffix) in src/coll that should 
                         be used for the collective routines.  Currently, 
                         name may be either intra_fns_new (the default) or
                         intra_fns .
--with-f90nag          - Choose the NAG f90 compiler for Fortran 
                         (preliminary version intended for use *instead* 
                         of a Fortran 77 compiler)
--with-f95nag          - Choose the NAG f95 compiler for Fortran
--with-cross=file      - Use the file for cross compilation. The file
                         should contain assignments of the form
                            CROSS_SIZEOF_INT=4
                         for each cross compilation variable.  The command
                            egrep 'CROSS_[A-Z_]*=' configure | sed 's/=.*//g'
                         will list each variable.

You can use --without-<featurename> to turn off a feature (except for 
device).

Features that may be included with MPICH

--enable-cxx          - Build C++ interfaces to the MPI-1 routines 
                        (default)
--enable-f77          - Build Fortran 77 interfaces to the MPI 
                        routines (default)
--enable-weak-symbols - Use weak symbols for MPI/PMPI routines.  This uses
                        weak symbols, if available, for the profiling 
                        interface (default)
--enable-debug        - Enable support for debuggers to access message 
                        queues
--enable-traceback    - Enable printing of a call stack when MPI and the
		        user's program is built with certain compilers 
			(currently only some versions of gcc are supported).
--enable-mpedbg       - Enable the -mpedbg command-line argument (e.g., 
                        errors can start an xterm running a debugger).  
                        Only works with some workstation systems.
--enable-sharedlib    - Attempt to build shared libraries.  Static 
--enable-sharedlib=dir  libraries are always built.  If a directory is
                        specified, the shared libraries will be placed in 
                        that directory.  This can be used to place the 
                        shared libraries in a uniform location in local 
                        disks on a cluster.
--enable-f90modules   - Build Fortran 90 module support (default if a
                        Fortran 90 or 95 compiler is found).  If ROMIO
                        is not built, no Fortran 90 modules will be built.

The following are intended for MPI implementors and debugging of configure
--enable-strict       - Try and build MPICH using strict options in Gnu gcc
--enable-echo         - Cause configure to echo what it does
--enable-devdebug     - Enable debugging code in the ADI.  

You can use --disable-<featurename> to turn off a feature.

Notes on configure usage:

The suggestions for GNU configure usage suggest that configure not be used
to build different tools, only controlling some basics of the features 
enabled or the packages included.  Our use of configure does not follow 
these rules because configure is too useful but we need the flexibility 
that allows the user to produce variations of MPICH.

More notes on command-line parameters:

You can select a different C and Fortran compiler by using the '-cc' and
'fc' switches.  The environment variables 'CC' and 'FC' can also provide
values for these but their settings may be overridden by the configure
script.  Using '-cc=\$CC -fc=\$FC' will force configure to use those
compilers.

The option '-opt' allows you to specify optimization options for the
compilers (both C and Fortran).  For example, '-opt=-O' chooses optimized
code generation on many systems.  '-optcc' and '-optf77' allow you to
specify options for just the C or Fortran compilers.  Use -cflags and
-fflags for options not related to optimization.  

Note that the '-opt' options are not passed to the 'mpicc', 'mpif77', 
'mpicxx', and 'mpif90' scripts.  The '-opt' options are used only in 
building MPICH.

The option '-lib' allows you to specify the location of a library that
may be needed by a particular device.  Most devices do NOT need this
option; check the installation instructions for those that might.

The option '-make' may be used to select an alternate make program.  For
example, to make use of VPATH builds (building in one directory with the
source in a different directory), -make=gnumake may be required.

The option '--disable-short-longs' may be used to suppress support for 
the C types 'long long' (a common extension) and 'long double' (ANSI/ISO C)
when they are the same size as 'long' and 'double' respectively.  Some 
systems allow these long C types, but generate a warning message when 
they are used; this option may be used to suppress these messages (and 
support for these types). '--disable-long-long' disables just 'long long';
'--disable-long-double' disables just 'long double'.

The option '-ar_nolocal' prevents the library archive command from
attempting to use the local directory for temporary space.  This option
should be used when (a) there isn't much space (less than 20 MB)
available in the partition where MPICH resides and (b) there is enough
space in /tmp (or wherever ar places temporary files by default).

The option '-noranlib' causes the 'ranlib' step (needed on some systems
to build an object library) to be skipped.  This is particularly useful
on systems where 'ranlib' is optional (allowed but not needed; because it
is allowed, configure chooses to use it just in case) but can fail (some
'ranlib's are implemented as scripts using 'ar'; if they don't use the
local directory, they can fail (destroying the library in the process) if
the temporary directory (usually '/tmp') does not have enough space.
This has occured on some OSF systems.

The environment variable 'RSHCOMMAND' allows you to select an alternative 
remote shell command (by default, configure will use 'rsh' or 'remsh' from 
your 'PATH').  If your remote shell command does not support the '-l' option
(some AFS versions of 'rsh' have this bug), also give the option
'-rshnol'.  These options are useful only when building a network version
of MPICH (e.g., '--with-device=ch_p4').  
The configure option '-rsh' is supported for backward compatibility.

Special Tuning Options:

There are a number of options for tuning the behavoir of the ADI
(Abstract Device Interface) which is the low-level message-passing
interface.  These should NOT be used unless you are sure you know what
you are doing.

The option '-pkt_size=LENGTH' allows you to choose the message length at
which the ADI (Abstract Device Interface) switches from its short to long
message format.  LENGTH must be positive.

The option '-adi_collective' allows the ADI to provide some collective
operations in addition to the basic point-to-point operations.
Currently, most systems do not support this option (it is ignored) and on
the others it has not been extensively tested.  

Options for Experts:

The option '-memdebug' enables extensive internal memory debugging code.
This should be used only if you are trying to find a memory problem (it
can be used to help find memory problems in user code as well).  Running
programs with the option '-mpidb memdump' will produce a summary, when 
'MPI_Finalize' is called, of all unfreed memory allocated my MPI.   For
example, a user-created datatype that was not later freed would be 
reported.

The option '-tracing' enables tracing of internal calls.  This should be
used only for debugging the MPICH implementation itself.

The option '-dlast' enables tracing of the most recent operations performed
by the device.  These can be output when a signal (like SIGINT), error, 
or call to a special routine occurs.  There is a performance penalty for
this option, but it can be very useful for implementors attempting to debug
problems.  

Sample Configure Usage:
