/* Update log
 *
 * Oct  6 2000 JHC: Add all of the MPI-2 relevant types and functions.
 *              This does need a compatibility number change to 
 *              ensure new libraries can't get loaded into old debuggers.
 *              New debuggers can continue to use old libraries, though.
 *              New functions under control of FOR_MPI2
 * Oct  2 2000 JHC: Add the mqs_get_comm_group function to support
 *              partial acquisition.
 * Mar 21 2000 JHC: Lower the version compatibility again, but add
 *              a new DLL provided call to tell us the width it
 *              believes mqs_taddr_t is. If the DLL doesn't provide this
 *              call, we assume it's old and use the appropriate old width.
 *              This lets us gracefully handle widening the interface on AIX.
 * Mar 17 2000 JHC: Add FORCE_32BIT_MPI conditional compilation flag.
 * Mar  3 2000 JHC: Widen the tword_t and taddr_t on AIX, now that IBM
 *              has 64 bit machines. Increment the version compatibility
 *              number on AIX (only) since this is an incompatible change in 
 *              the interface.
 * Oct  1 1998 JHC: Change MQS_INVALID_PROCESS to -1, TV would never generate
 *              the old value anyway.
 * May 26 1998 JHC: Change interface compatibility, add extra strings in the
 *              mqs_pending_operation.
 * Apr 23 1998 JHC: Make mqs_tword_t and mqs_taddr_t into 64 bit entities on
 *              SGI. Expand the comment above their definition.
 * Mar  9 1998 JHC: Added mqs_sizeof_ft. Of course we always needed this !
 * Nov  6 1997 JHC: Worked over somewhat to keep John happy :-)
 * Oct 27 1997 James Cownie <jcownie@dolphinics.com>: Created.

/***********************************************************************
 * This header file defines the interface between a debugger and a
 * dynamically loaded library use to implement access to MPI message
 * queues.
 *
 * The interface is specified at the C level, to avoid C++ compiler issues.
 *
 * The interface allows code in the DLL to 
 * 1) find named types from the debugger's type system and look up fields in them
 * 2) find the address of named external variables 
 * 3) access objects at absolute addresses in the target process.
 * 4) convert objects from target format to host format.
 *
 * A number of different objects are passed backwards and forwards
 * between the debugger and the DLL :-
 *
 * executable images
 * processes
 * communicators
 *
 * Many of these are opaque to the DLL, in such cases they will be
 * defined in the interface as pointers to opaque structures, since
 * this provides type checking while maintaining information hiding.
 *
 * All named entities in here start with the prefix "mqs_" (for
 * Message Queue Support), all the debugger callbacks are made via 
 * callback tables, so the real (linkage) names of the functions are
 * not visible to the DLL.
